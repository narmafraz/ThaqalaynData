            " 6. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Musafir who has said the following. “Abu Ibrahim commanded –at the time he was taken out to Baghdad- abu al-Hassan (a.s.) to sleep every night at his (abu Ibrahim’s) house until the coming of the news of his death. The narrator has said narrator has said that we would prepare the bed for abu al-Hassan every night in the terrace and he would come after the ‘Isha (late evening) to rest and in the morning he would leave for his own house. He has said that it continued for four years. One night he delayed and the bed was prepared for him. He did not come as usual and the family was alarmed and deeply saddened. His delay was a very great matter that overwhelmed us. In the morning he came to the house and went to the family room to ’Umm (mother of) Ahmad and said to her, “Bring me the things that my father had entrusted you with.” She began to cry, beat up her face and tear her clothe over her heart saying, “My master, by Allah, has passed away.” He stopped her and said, “Do not say any thing to any one and do not make it public before the news of his death comes to the governor.” She then brought a package, a two thousand and a four thousand Dinar and gave all of it to him and to one else. She said, “He had told me when there were only two of us (She was beloved to him), “Keep this trust well protected with you and do allow anyone to know it before I will die. When I will die whichever of my sons will come to and ask you to deliver this trust to him give it to him and know that I have passed away. The sign that my master had informed me of has exactly come.” He took charge of the package and money from her and commanded everyone to keep it secret until the coming of the news. He left the house and thereafter did not come to rest at night as before. After a few days only the news of the passing away of abu Ibrahim reach the city. We calculated the time and found out that it was exactly the time abu al-Hassan had done those things; his delaying to come for rest at night and taking charge of the trust with (’Umm Ahamd).”"
