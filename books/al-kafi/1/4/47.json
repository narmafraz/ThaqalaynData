This is his dwelling place and his bed which, has enough room and he is not constrained. Amir al-Mu’minin (Harun al-Rashid) has not done any bad things to him. He is kept here until the right time comes so he can debate Amir al-Mu’minin (Harun al-Rashid). He is quite well and comfortable from all aspects. You may ask him questions.” The narrator has said, “We had no other intention but to see to the man, to his virtue and his excellent attitude. Musa ibn Ja‘far (a.s.) then said, “Whatever he (al-Sindi) has said about the capacity of the place and other such things are as he has said. However, O people, I let you know that I am being poisoned with seven pieces of dates.
