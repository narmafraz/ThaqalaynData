            " Al-Kulayni, may grant him blessings has said the following. “Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has invented the whole world for His deputy as He has said to His angels. “When your Lord said to the angels, “I am appointing someone as my deputy on earth, . .” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:2#h30\">[2:30]</a> The whole world was for Adam and after him it belonged to the good ones among his descendants and his successors. Whatever their enemies had taken away from them came back to them through war or conquest that is called Fay’. It is the propety that would come to the as a result of conquest or war. The rules for such properties in it (the book) is as Allah has said, “Know that whatever property you may gain, one fifth belongs to God, the Messenger, the kindred, orphans, the needy and those who need money while on a journey. . .” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:8#h41\">[8:41]</a> Such properties belong to Allah, the Messenger and the relatives of the Messenger. Such properties are called al-Fay’ (taken back). It is the property taken back from others by force. However, whatever would come to them without the use of force and resources such as horses and man it is called al-Anfal. This kind of properties belong to Allah and the Messenger only and no one else woill have any share in it. Others can have shares only in what is acquired through blood shed and fighting. All those who would take part in the struggle will have certain shares. Properties taken in such way is divided into four portions out of which one would belong to the Messeenger. The portion that belongs to the Messenger is divided into six portions. Three will be for him and the other three for the orphans. The destitute and those left without means on a journey. However, the case of al-Anfal is different. It belongs to the Messenger only. Of such properties was Fadak that belonged to the Messenger of Allah only. It is because he and Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) conquered it and there no one else took part. The name al-Fay’ therefore does not apply to it. Al-Anfal applies to it. Similar to al-Anfal are such properties as the marshes, mines, oceans and the wilderness. They all belong to Imam exclusively. If people would work in them by the permission of the Imam four fifth will belong to them for labor and one fifth would belong to the Imam. Such one fifth is like al-Khums. If people would work in such properties without the permission of the Imam, the Imam will have all of it and no one would have any thing in them. The same would be the case if someone would work, revive, improve, develop and build on a land without the permission of the Imam. It would be up to the Imam to leave it with him or take it away from him or settle it differently.”"

            "(It has been narrated) from Al-Abd Al-Salih<sup>asws</sup> (7<sup>th</sup> Imam<sup>asws</sup>) having said: ‘The fifth (Al-Khums) is from five things – from the spoils (of war), and the diving, and from treasures, and from the mines and the salt-works. The fifth (Khums) would be taken from all of these types and it would be made to be for the ones whom Allah<sup>azwj</sup> the Exalted Made it to be for, and four-fifths would be distributed upon the ones who fought upon it and the ones who supported that.",
            "And the fifth would be distributed upon six shares – a share being for Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, and a share for Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup>, and a share for the near of kin, and a share for the orphans, and a share for the poor, and a share for the children of the way (needy travellers). ",
            "So the share of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> and the share of Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> is for the Master<sup>asws</sup> of the Command (Wali Al-Amr) from after Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> as an inheritance. Thus, for him<sup>asws</sup> would be three shares, two share as an inheritance and a share distributed for him<sup>asws</sup> (being near of kin) from Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, and for him<sup>asws</sup> would be half of the complete Khums; and the remaining half of the Khums would be between his<sup>asws</sup> family members. ",
            "Therefore, the share of the orphans, and the share of the poor, and the share of the children of the way (needy travellers), he<sup>asws</sup> would distribute between them based upon the Book and the Sunnah what they would become needless with during their year. So if there is anything excess from them, so it would be for the Guardian<sup>asws</sup>, and if there is frustration or a deficiency from their becoming needless, it would be upon the Guardian<sup>asws</sup> that he<sup>asws</sup> spends from him<sup>asws</sup> by a measurement of what they could become needless with. ",
            "And rather, it has come to be upon him<sup>asws</sup> that he<sup>asws</sup> prevents them, because for him<sup>asws</sup> is what is excess from them, and rather Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Made the Khums to be especially for them, besides the poor ones of the people and their needy travellers as an alternate for them from the charities of the people as a distinction from Allah<sup>azwj</sup> for them due to their near relationship with Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> and a Prestige from Allah<sup>azwj</sup> for them, from the grime of the people. ",
            "Thus, he<sup>asws</sup> makes it to be for them in particular, from Him<sup>azwj</sup> what they could be needless with that from coming into a place of disgrace and neediness. And there is no problem with the charities of some of them upon the others, and they are those for whom Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Made the Khums. They are the near of kin of the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> whom Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Mentioned, and He<sup>azwj</sup> Said <span class=\"ibTxt\"><a href=\"/#/books/quran:26#h214\">[26:214]</a> And warn your nearest relations</span>, and they are the Clan of Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> themselves, the males from them and the females. There aren’t among them from the people of the households of the Qureysh, nor from the Arabs anyone, nor among them, nor from them in this Khums from any of their friends, and the charities of the people has been Made permissible for their friends, and they and the people are equal. ",
            "The one whose mother was from the Clan of Hashim and his father was from the rest of the Qureysh, so the charities would be Permissible for him and there wouldn’t be anything for him from the Khums because Allah<sup>azwj</sup> the Exalted is Saying <span class=\"ibTxt\"><a href=\"/#/books/quran:33#h5\">[33:5]</a> Assert their relationship to their fathers</span>.

            "And for the Imam<sup>asws</sup> is the clean wealth that he<sup>asws</sup> should take from these wealth, the cleanest of it – the luxurious maid, and the luxurious animal, and the clothes and the chattels. Whatever he<sup>asws</sup> loves or desires, so that is for him before the distribution and before the extraction of the Khums. And for him<sup>asws</sup> is that he<sup>asws</sup> supports with that wealth the entirety of what he<sup>asws</sup> is represented with from the likes of grants to incline their hearts and other than that from what he<sup>asws</sup> is represented with. ",
            "So if something were to remain after that, the Khums would be extracted from it and it would be distributed among his<sup>asws</sup> family and the remainder would be distributed upon the ones who is the governor of that, and if there does not remain anything after the support of the representatives, then there would not be anything for them. And there isn’t anything for the fighter from the (captured) lands, nor what they overcome upon except for what the army encompasses upon. ",
            "And there isn’t anything for the Bedouins from the distribution and even though they may have found along with the administrator, because Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> reconciled with the Bedouins that he<sup>saww</sup> would leave them to be in their houses and they would not emigrate upon the stipulation that if Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> is ever raided from his<sup>saww</sup> enemies with a raid, they would make them flee and fight with them and there wouldn’t be a share for them in the spoils, and his<sup>saww</sup> Sunnah flows in them and in the others.",
            "And the lands which are seized forcibly by cavalry horses and (infantry) men, so it would be suspended, left in the hands of the one who would build these and revive these, and look after upon these upon what the administrator would reconcile with them in accordance of their strength from the right, the half or the third or the two-third, and upon a measurement of what would happen to be correct for them, and he would not harm them. ",
            "So if there comes forth from it what comes forth (harvest), so a tenth would be taken out from the entirety of what the sky has irrigated, or the clouds irrigate, and (it would be) half of the tenth (5%) from what is irrigated by the buckets or the dams. So the administrator would take it and divert it in the perspective which Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Diverted, upon eight shares – for the poor, and the needy, and the workers upon it, and the ones inclined of hearts, and regarding (freeing) of the slaves, and the creditors, and in the Way of Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, and the needy traveller. ",
            "(These) eight shares being distributed between them in their places by a measurement of what they could become needless with it during their years with neither being constricted nor being thrifty. So if there is anything excess from that, it would be returned to the administrator, and if something is deficient from that and they are not sufficed with it, it would be upon the administrator that he gifts it from him in accordance with their capacity until they become needless. ",
            "And he (the administrator) would take afterwards, whatever remains from the tenth, and it would be distributed between the administrator and his associated, those who work the earth and supervise it. So he would hand their shares to them upon what he can reconcile them upon, and he would take the remainder, so that it would happen to be a sustenance for his supporters upon the Religion of Allah<sup>saww</sup> and in the interests of what he is represented from the strengthening of Al-Islam and the strengthening of the Religion in its aspects of the Jihad and other than that, from what therein is the general interest of the people, and there isn’t anything for himself from that, be it little of more. ",
            "And for him, after the Khums, is the Anfal, and the Anfal is every barren land which its people have perished, and every land not seized upon neither by a cavalry nor an infantry, but they have reconciled with a reconciliation and they have given with their own hands without any fighting. And for him (the administrator) would be the peaks of the mountains and the interior of the valleys, and the bushes, and every dead land with no owner for it; and for him would be the properties of the kings what was in their hands from without an aspect of usurpation, because the usurpation, all of it is returnable, and he would be an inheritor of the one who has no inheritor for him, and a supporter for whom there is no supporter for him.",
            "And he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> did not neglects anything from the varieties of the wealth except and He<sup>azwj</sup> has Apportioned it and Given it to every one with a right, his right, the special and the general, and the poor and the needy, and every variety from the varieties of the people’. ",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘If justice is done among the people, they would become needless’. Then he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘The justice is sweeter than the honey, and he cannot do justice except the one who is good of justice. And it was so that Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> distributed the charities of the people of the valleys among the people of the valleys, and the charities of the people of the towns among the people of the towns, and he<sup>azwj</sup> did not apportion between them with the equal-ness upon the eight (categories) until he<sup>saww</sup> gave the people of each share, an eighth (of the total), but he<sup>saww</sup> distributed it upon a measurement of the ones who were present from the eight varieties, upon a measurement of what each category from them could be able to stay for his year. ",
            "There isn’t anything dedicated nor specified, nor written. But rather, that is upon a measurement of what he<sup>saww</sup> saw and what was presented to him<sup>saww</sup> until he<sup>saww</sup> eliminated the destitution of every people from them. And if there was an excess from that, he<sup>saww</sup> distributed the total wealth upon the others’.  ",
            "And the Anfal is to the administrator, and every land conquered during the days of the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> up to the last, for ever. And whatever was conquered by the calling of the people of tyranny and people of the justice, because the responsibility of Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> among the former ones and the later ones, is one (and the same), because Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> said: ‘The Muslims are brethren. Their bloods are sufficed with and their responsibilities are strived for by the lowest of them’. ",
            "And there isn’t any Zakat in the wealth of the Khums, because the poor people, their sustenance is made to be in the wealth of the people upon eight portions, therefore there does not remain even one of them. And for the poor of the relatives of Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> is half the Khums, so they are needless by it from the charities of the people, and the charities of the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> and the Master<sup>asws</sup> of the Command (Wali Al-Amr).",
            "Thus, there does not remain a poor one from the poor of the people, and there does not remain a poor one from the poor relatives of Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> but they have been made needless. Therefore, there would be no poor ones due to that. The Zakat does not happen to be upon the wealth of the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> and the administrator because there does not remain a poor needy one, but upon them are things given to them from its perspective, and for them, from that perspective is like what is upon them’."

            " 4. Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from certain persons of our people from the virtuous servant of Allah who has said the following. “Al-Khums (one fifth) is due on five categories of properties. 1 Cattle 2 Properties acquired from diving deep waters 3 The treasures 4 The mines and Salts. On each of such categories al-Khums is due. Such one fifth is distributed just as Allah has done. The remaining four portions is distributed among those who has taken part in the actual fighting or those lending support behind the front. The one fifth is distributed as follows. One portion for Allah, one the Messenger of Allah, one for the relatives (of the Messenger of Allah), one for the orphans, one for the destitute and one portion for those who become needy on a journey. Thus, the portion for Allah and the Messenger of Allah belong to Leadership with Divine Authority after the Messenger of Allah as the portion of inheritance. Thus, he (Leadership with Divine Authority) will have three portions. Two portions as inheritance and one is that which Allah has granted to him. Fifty percent of al-Khums (one fifth) belongs to him, the Imam (Leader with Divine Authority). The other fifty percent of al-Khums belongs to his family members. One portion for the orphans thereof, one portion for the destitute thereof, one portion for those of them who become needy while on a journey. It is distributed among them according to the rules in the book and the Sunnah. The limit is an amount that would suffice their expenses for a whole year. If any thing is left extra it will go to the Wali, (Leadership with Divine Authority). In the case of deficit the Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority) is responsible to provide and pay the deficit and as much as it would fulfill their needs. Wali is responsible to pay the deficit because the extra is given to him. Allah has given this one fifth exclusively to them and not the destitute from the masses and those of them who become needy on a journey as a replacement for the charities due on people. It is a sign of honor for them because of their being the relatives of the Messenger of Allah and an honor from Allah to keep them secure from the filth in the hands of people. Thus is for them only as sustenance and save them from humiliation and destitution. They may receive other forms of charities from each other. Those for whom is al-Khums are the relatives of the Holy Prophet (s.a) whom Allah has mentioned in His words. “Warn your close relatives.” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:26#h214\">[26:214]</a> They are the sons of ‘Abd al-Muttalib themselves, male and female. No one of the families of Quraysh or the Arabs is of them. Among them or from them also is none of their slave to have a portion in al-Khums. The charities of the masses of people is lawful for their slaves to consume. Their slaves and the masses of people are the same. One whose mother is from the family of Hashim and his father from the masses of people the charities are lawful for such person to consume. Such person is not entitled to receive from al-Khums because Allah, the Most High has said, “Call them sons of their own fathers.” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:33#h5\">[33:5]</a> The properties of the best quality of such properties go as the portion of the Imam. The female slave, the best horse, the best cloths and other items that are like and desired for. Such items go to him before the distribution and before the subtraction of al-Khums. He will pay and maintain with such properties, the causes where he would need to pay such as grants to people who are inclined to the system of faith etc. If anything would be left extra then al-Khums is taken out therefrom and is distributed to the causes for which it is. If any thing is left extra then it is give to the Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority). If nothing is left after the expenses then there is nothing for the Wali. Nothing from the land goes to the fighters. So also is the properties that are acquire by overwhelming except for what the army his physically captured. The Bedouins have no share in the distribution even if they would take part in fighting with the Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority). It is because the Messenger of Allah reached a settlement with them. It said, “They will not be exiled and that if the Messenger of Allah will be attacked by his enemies they will come to help to fight the enemy but will have no share in the properties of the enemies confiscated.” This practice has been continuous ever since about them and others. The lands that were capture by the forces of the army will remain in the public domain. The developers may keep them and reach a settlement with the Wali who would use his discretion in the matter. The may find a fair and proportionate and fair agreement on the basis of proper protection of all parties rights and interests. The apportionment may take shape in the form of a third, two thirds etc. The tax on whatever is harvested will be ten percent if the plantation is irrigated by rain. It is five percent if irrigation is from mechanical means. Wali collects this tax and spends on the causes that Allah has described which are eight categories. 1 The needy, 2 the destitute, 3 the employees of the taxation office, 4 the people who sympathize with the faith, 5 to set free the slaves, 6 to help the bankrupt, 7 for the cause of Allah and 8 to help those who become needy on a journey. Each cause can receive an amount enough for its expenses and maintenance for up to one year in a reasonable manner. If anything would b e left extra it goes to the Wali if it would not suffice the Wali must provide the needed fund from his resources. The ten percent tax is divided between the Wali and his partners such as workers and supervisors of the land. They will receive their shares according to the standing agreements. The remaining will be spent on those who help him in the matters of religion of Allah and in the interest of Islam and the strengthening of the religion such as defense etc., in which there is general but not personal interest. It is for his personal interests small or large. Besides al-Khums for Imam there is al-Anfal. Al-Anfal is every kind of abandoned land whose owners are no more and all the lands that are acquired without the use of force and fighting but are achieved through settlement and their owners have given them to the Imam without fight. To the Imam belongs the mountains, inside of the valleys, marshes and undeveloped lands that has no owners. To belongs the properties of the kings (defeated) if such properties would not be usurped. The usurped properties are all returned to the owner. The Imam is the heir of those who have no heirs. He supports those who have no supporters. The Imam (a.s.) said, “There is no category of the properties that Allah may not have distributed and has given every rightful person his or her rights of the general of particular nature of the needy and the destitute and all categories of people.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “If justice would be practice among the people they will become free from want.” The Imam (a.s.) then said, “Justice is more sweet than honey. No one practices it properly except those who good in justice.” The Imam (a.s.) then said, “The Messenger of Allah would distribute the charities of the rural areas in the rural areas and the charities of the towns to the people of the towns. He would not divide every amount of charity receive into eight portions. He would divide it proportionate to the categories of the causes present before him and to the degree that for each cause that would suffice it for one year. There was no limit of time or a certain date or the combination of both. He would base it on what was available and who was present and how much of need of each category could have been fulfilled. He would offer the remaining to other people. Al-Anfal belongs to the Wali and so is all the lands that were captured during the time of the Holy Prophet (s.a) to eternity. It does not matter the conquest was made through the people of justice or otherwise, because the responsibility of the the Messenger of Allah in one and the same in the past, present or future generations. It is because the Messenger of Allah said, “Muslims are equal in the matters of lives. Even the small ones among them strive for the fulfillment of their responsibilities. There is no Zakat on al-Khums property. It is because the shares of the needy from the masses are placed in the properties of the people in eight categories. No one of the needy in the masses is left out. The needy from the relatives of the Messenger of Allah have their share in the fifty percent of al-Khums. This suffices them and they do not need the charities of the masses, the charities of the Holy Prophet (s.a) and the Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority). In this way the system leaves no one as a needy of the masses or of the relatives of the Messenger of Allah without proper coverage and well fare benefits. All the needy benefit. For this reason there is not tax on the properties of the Holy Prophet (s.a) or Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority). It is because for all kinds of needs there is resources in the system to facilitate them. There are responsibilities as well as rights.”"

            " 5. Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah has narrated from Certain persons of our people that I thinks is al-Sayyari from Ali ibn Asbat who has said the following. “In one of the meetings of abu al-Hassan Musa (a.s.) with al-Mahdi (one of ‘Abbassid ruler) the Imam found him paying reparations (for the damages caused to people). The Imam (a.s.) said, “O Amir al-Mu’minin, what has happened to the reparations due to us?” He then asked, “What damage is caused to you O abu al-Hassan ?” He (the Imam (a.s.) said, “Allah, the Holy, the Most High, granted victory to His Holy Prophet (s.a) and the land of Fadak and its surrounding areas came under his control without any armed struggle Allah sent a message to His the Holy Prophet (s.a). It said, “Give the relatives their rights.” The Messenger of Allah did not know who they were. He turned to Jibril to find out and Jibril turned to his Lord for the answer. Allah then sent revelation to him to give possession of Fadak to Fatima (a.s.). Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah called Fatima and said to her. “O Fatima (a.s.) Allah has commanded me to give possession of Fadak to you. She then said, “ O the Messenger of Allah, I have accepted the offer from Allah and from you.” Thereafter her representatives lived there during the life time of the Messenger of Allah. When abu Bakr took control he expelled her representatives therefrom. She went to abu Bakr and asked him to reverse his decision and return Fadak to her but he said to Fatima (a.s.), “Bring to a black or white to testify that Fadak belonged to you.” Fatima (a.s.) brought Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.) and ’Umm Ayman who both testified in favor of Fatima (a.s.). He then wrote, “Fatima must not be disturbed in the matters of Fadak.” Fatima then left with the document. On the way ‘Umar came from the opposite direction and asked, “What is it in your hand O daughter of Muhammad?” Fatima (a.s.) said, “It is a document that ibn abu Quhafa has written for me.” He said, “Show it to me.” Fatima refused to hand it over to him but he snatched it away from her hand and read it. He then spit on it wiped out its writing and tore it into pieces. He said, “This was not captured by forces of the camels and horses of your father so that you can tie the rope around our necks.” Al-Mahdi said, “O abu al-Hassan define for me the boundaries of Fadak.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “On one side it borders the mountain of ’Uhud. On the other side is ‘Arish Misr. Also it borders Sayf al-Bahr and on one of its sides is Dawmat al-Jandal.” Then he asked the Imams, “Is that all?” He said, “Yes, O Amir al-Mu’minin, this is all that came to the Messenger of Allah without the use of the forces of the camels and horses.” He said, “This is a large area but I will look into it.”"

Ahmad ibn Muhammad has narrated from mmd ibn Sinan from Yunus ibn ya‘qub from ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Na’fi‘ who has said the following. “We asked permission from abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) and sent him a message. He then sent us a message that told two of us should meet him at one time. I and a man with me went to meet him. I said to the man, “I like you to ask permission to ask questions.” He said, “Yes, I will do so.” He then said to the Imam (a.s.), may Allah take my soul in service for your cause, my father was taken as a captive by the ’Umayyids. I know that ’Umayyids did not consider lawful and unlawful matters and that they did not have any right in all that was in their possession in large or small quantities but that they rightfully belonged to you. When I think how much must return to you I get a feeling that almost destroys my power of reason.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “You are free from such obligation as well as all those who is in same conditions as you are, are also from such obligations after me.” The narrator has said, “We than left and Mut‘ab.(the servant) reached the next group who were to meet the Imam (a.s.) before us and said, “’Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Na’fi‘ has succeeded in what no one before him had ever done.” They asked, “What is it?” He then explained it to them. Then two of them went to see the Imam (a.s.) One of them said, “May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, my father was a captive in the hands of the ’Umayyids. I knew that the ’Umayyids. Had no legal control over all that had in small or large amounts. I would like that you would set me free from the liabilities.” The Imam (a.s.) said, “Is that up us?” It is not up us. We have no right to make thing lawful or unlawful.” The two men then left. Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) became angry. No one then went to see him but that abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) began to say, “Are you not surprised at so and so? He comes to me to legalize what th ’Umayyids. Had done? He thinks it is up to us. That night no one benefited less or more except the first two people. They gained what they needed.”"

Sahl has narrated from Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Hamadani who has said the following. “I wrote to abu al-Hassan (a.s.) , ‘ail ibn Mahziyar read to me the letter of your father (a.s.) that said, “The owners of gardens pay three percent after deducting the expenses. Those whose gardens would not produce even the expenses there is nothing due on them.” A difference of opinion has risen among our people. They say that on the produce of the gardens there is al-Khums after the deduction of the expenses, the expenses of the garden not the expenses of the owner and his family. The Imam (a.s.) wrote back in answer, “Al-Khums is due after the deduction of the taxes to government and the expenses of one’s family.”"
