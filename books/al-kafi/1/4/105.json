The good end is for those who are pious before Allah’, I and my Ahl al-Bayt are the people to whom Allah has given the earth in inheritance and we are the ones who are pious before Allah. The whole earth belongs to us. Thus, whoever of the Muslims would revive a land, he must establish it, pay taxes to the Imam from my Ahl al-Bayt. Whatever he has used would be his. If he would abandon or allow to become barren and another Muslim would revive and re establish it he will have more right to it than the one who have abandoned. This person will now pay the taxes to the Imam from my Ahl al-Bayt and whatever he would use thereafter is his until Al-Qa’im from my Ahl al-Bayt will rise with Divine Authority and with the sword. He will control and protect them and will remove from them just as the Messenger of Allah had controlled and protected it, except, however, for what would be in the hands of our followers. He will form a contract with them and will leave the land to them.”"

Do you not know that both this and the next world belong to the Imam? He can place them as he may want or give them to whoever he may want. It is permissible for him from Allah. The Imam said, O abu Muhammad, the Imam never spends a night without Allah‘s right on him for which He would not ask him.”"
