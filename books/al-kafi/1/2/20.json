Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from certain persons of his people from Harun ibn Muslim from Mas‘ada ibn Sadaqa from abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) who has said the following. “Imam Ali (a.s.) said, ‘O people, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has sent to you the holy Prophet (s.a.) and gave him the book with truth while you all were illiterate (ignorant) about the book and the One Who revealed it and about the messenger and the One Who sent him in a period of time wherein no messenger had been sent, during a prolonged delinquency of the nations with wide spread ignorance, over-looming afflictions, the crumbling of the established social order, blindness towards the truth, the practice of injustice, the destruction of religion, the raging of wars, at the time of paling away of the gardens of the worldly life, the withering away of the branches therein, the scattering away of its protectors, the loss of hope of its fruits, the drying out of its waters and the decadence of its lighthouses. At such a period of time the elements of wickedness had been manifest everywhere. The world seemed aggressive, rough and frowning at the face of its inhabitants, regressing instead of helping to progress and with wicked fruits. Its food was but carrion, its slogan fear and the swords as overall garments. You were totally crushed and the eyes of the inhabitants of the world had turned blind, their days dark. They had boycotted their relatives, caused much bloodshed and buried their baby-girls alive, expecting thereby goodness of life and worldly tranquility. They would not cherish any hope in the rewards of Allah or preserve any fear of the punishment of Allah. Their living were blind and filthy and their dead in the fire in total despair. “At such time came to them a copy of what was in the ancient pages (of guidance) and a confirmation of what existed with them, containing a complete account of the lawful and unlawful matters. That is the holy Quran ask it for the answers but it will not speak to you. I can tell you about it. In it there is the knowledge of the past and the knowledge of what comes in the future up to the Day of Judgement. Therein is the rule (needed) among you and to settle your disputes that may arise therein.’”"
