            "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn Mahbub from abu Waffad af-Hannat from Humran who has said the following: “Abu Ja‘far, Alayhi al-Salam, has said that ’Amir al-Mu’minin has stated this Hadith. ‘Once a Muslim woman came to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and said, “O Messenger (of Allah) so and so married me. I gave birth to many children for him. I helped him in his world and religion and he has not seen any dislikeable things from me. I complain against him before Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, and before you.” He (the Messenger of Allah) asked, “What is your complaint against him?” She replied, “Today he said to me, ‘You are unlawful for me like the back of my mother is.’ He expelled me from my house, please look into my affairs.” The Messenger of Allah said, “Allah has not sent down any book by which I can decide between you and your husband and I do not like to take the trouble on myself.” She began to weep and complain before Allah and His Messenger and returned. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, heard her conversations with His Messenger, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, about her husband and what she complained about. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent a reading about it: “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Allah has certainly heard the words of the woman who argued with you about her husband and who (after not having received a favorable response from you) complained to Allah. Allah was listening to your argument [meaning the statements of the Messenger of Allah about her husband]. Allah is All hearing and All aware. <a href=\"/#/books/quran:58#h1\">[58:1]</a> “Those who renounce their wives by calling them to be as their mothers should know that their wives could never become their mothers. Their mothers are those who have given birth to them. The words that they speak are certainly detestable and sinful. However, Allah is Pardoning and All forgiving.” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:58#h2\">[58:2]</a>’ “The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, sent for her and she came. He (the Messenger of Allah) said to bring her husband before him. She brought her husband. He (the Messenger of Allah) asked, ‘Have you said this to your wife, ‘you are unlawful to me like the back of my mother is?’ He replied, ‘I have said so to her.’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, said, ‘Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has sent verses of al-Quran about you and your wife.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) read for him what Allah had revealed, ‘Allah has heard the words of the woman . . . Allah is Pardoning and All-forgiving.’ <a href=\"/#/books/quran:58#h2\">[58:2]</a> Hold your wife to yourself because you have said evil and sinful words. Allah has forgiven you and has pardoned you. You must not do such thing again.’ The man returned and he was regretful because of what he had said to his wife. Allah disliked it for the believers thereafter and then He revealed, ‘Those who involve themselves in Zihar against their women then return from what they have said. . .’ meaning when the first man said to his wife, ‘You are unlawful to me like the back of my mother.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Whoever says it after Allah pardoned and forgave the first man, “must set free a slave before touching (going to bed with) his wife. This is how Allah gives advice and Allah is well aware of what you do. If one cannot set free a slave he must fast for two consecutive months before touching each other. If one cannot do this also then he must feed sixty destitute people.” Allah has sanctioned this penalty after He prohibited Zihar and said, “This is done so that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and such are the laws of Allah.” Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has sanctioned this penalty because of Zihar.’” Humran has said that abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Zihar does not take place by swearing, harming and in anger. Zihar can only take place during a Hayd (menses)-free period and without sexual intercourse and in the presence of two Muslim witnesses.’” "

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Ali ibn Mahziyar from who has said the following: “‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad once wrote to abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, saying, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, certain ones of your followers think that if a man speaks the statement of al-Zihar, then expiation becomes due, violating the swearing or not. They say that its sinfulness and violation is in the very statement of al-Zihar and expiation is as penalty for such statement. Certain others think that expiation is not due unless swearing is violated in something about which he swears, and if he violates then expiation is due on him, otherwise, there is no expiation. He (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, signed the answer in his own handwriting that said, ‘Expiation does not become obligatory until violation of oath occurs.”’ "

            "(It has been narrated) from Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup>, said, ‘I asked him<sup>asws</sup> about a man who said to his wife, ‘You are unto me like the back of my mother’, or ‘like her hand’, or ‘like her belly’, or like her private part’, or like herself’, or ‘like her heels’, does that happen to be <span class=\"iTxt\">Zahaar</span>, and does it necessitate him in it what necessitates the perpetrator of <span class=\"iTxt\">Zahaar</span>?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘The perpetrator of <span class=\"iTxt\">Zahaar</span>, when he does <span class=\"iTxt\">Zahaar</span> from his wife, so he says she is like the back of his mother, or her hand, or like her feet, or like her hair, or anything from her, meaning by that the prohibition, so the expiation necessitates upon him in everything little from it or more, and similar to that is when he says it to some close relatives, so the expiation is necessitated upon him’."

            "36. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Salih ibn Sa‘id from Yunus from certain persons of his people who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the case of a man, who expresses the statement of al-Zihar about his wife. He says, ‘For me you are like the back of my mother or like her hand, or like her belly, or like her vagina, or like her soul, or like her feet’; if this is al-Zihar and if he owes what one who expressed the statement of al-Zihar owes. He (the Imam) said, ‘If one expresses the statement of al-Zihar about his wife and says that she is like the back of his mother to him, or like her hand, like her leg, her hairs or something of her with the intention for it to be unlawful, then expiation becomes obligatory in a little or more of it. So also is the case if he says that she is like his relatives and expiation becomes obligatory on him.’” "
