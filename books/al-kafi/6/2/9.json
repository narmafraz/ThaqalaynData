He has mentioned that he asked Muhammad ibn Hamzah about how to arrange witnesses for his word, T’tadi’ (you must commence your waiting period). He said that one must say, ‘Bear witness 7 ‘tadi’ (commence waiting period).’ Ibn Sama‘ah has said, ‘Muhammad ibn abu Hamzah has made a mistake in saying, ‘Bear witness ‘ ‘1‘tadi’ (commence waiting period).’ Al-Hassan ibn Sama‘ah has said that it is proper to come with witnesses to her place or take her to the witnesses to their homes and this is not possible to happen. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, does not make it obligatory on His slaves. Al-Hassan has said, ‘Divorce is nothing other than what Bukayr ibn ‘A‘yan has narrated that one must say to her when she is clean of Hayd (menses) without sexual intercourse ‘Anti Taliq ’ (you are let go) or ‘ 7 ‘tadi’ (commence waiting period) in the presence of two witnesses.
