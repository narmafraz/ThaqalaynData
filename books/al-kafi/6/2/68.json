So if her husband were to come before the fulfillment of her waiting period, from the day the guardian divorced her, so it would be inevitable for him to revert to her, for she is his wife, and she is with him upon the two (remaining) divorces.

He (the Imam) said, ‘If she is silent and has exercised patience, she is not disturbed, but if she brings her case before the authorities she will be told to wait for four years. Thereafter they write to the area where he has disappeared to find out about him. If information is achieved that he is alive, she then must wait; but if no information is found until four years the guardian of the husband is summoned and asked if any assets belonging to the missing man exist. If such assets exist then her maintenance must be paid therefrom until it is found out if he is alive or not. If no asset belonging to him exists his guardian is told to provide her maintenance. If his guardian provides her maintenance she has no way to marry; but if he did not provide her maintenance the authority then compels him to divorce her one divorce before her commencing waiting period when she is in a Hayd (menses)-free period. Divorce by the guardian is treated like the divorce of the husband. If the husband comes before the end of her waiting period from the day divorce has taken place and he decides to go back to her, she is his wife. She is for him for two more divorces, but if he comes after her waiting period ends then she becomes lawful for marriage to whoever she likes and the first husband has no way to her.’” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, he is compelled to do so. If he does not have any guardian, the authority and al- Sultan divorces her.’ I then asked what happens if the guardian says, ‘I can provide her maintenance?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He is not then forced to divorce her.’ I then asked what happens if she says, ‘I want what women want, I do not want to wait patiently as I am.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She does not have such right and it is not honorable to say so when he provides maintenance.’” "
