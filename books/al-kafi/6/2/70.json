Then her first husband comes. She then separates from him and he from her and about how long is her waiting period. He (the Imam) said, ‘It is three Hayd (menses)-free periods. She only needs to place her womb in quarantine for three Hayd (menses)-free periods and thereafter she becomes lawful for anyone of all people.’ Zurarah has said that it is because people said she needs two waiting periods, one waiting period because of each one. Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, rejected it and said, ‘She must count three Hayd (menses)-free periods and thereafter she becomes lawful for men for marriage.’” "
