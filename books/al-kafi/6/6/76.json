            "9. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from abu Ayyub al-Khazzaz from Muhammad ibn Muslim who has said the following: “He (the Imam), ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that once scorpion bit the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and he (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘May Allah condemn you. You do not distinguish between a believer and unbeliever and do not know whom you can hurt’. He (the Messenger of Allah) then asked for salt and rubbed it on the bitten place and it calmed down. Abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘Had people known that which is in salt they would not seek another antidote.’” "
