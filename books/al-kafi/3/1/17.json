He then immersed his left hand in the water and took some water, which he poured on his right forearm, washed therewith his right hand from his elbow to his palm and did not rub it backward to his elbow. He then immersed the palm of his right hand in the water, poured water over his left forearm from the elbow and worked with it as he did with his right hand. He then wiped his head and his feet with moisture in his palm. He did not take new water in his hands. He did not push his hand under his shoelace. He then said, ‘Allah, the most Majestic, most Glorious, says, “Believers, when you rise for Salah (prayer) wash your faces and hands.” He must not have left any part of his face without being washed. He commanded him to wash his hands upto (from) the elbows. He must not have left his hands without being washed upto (from) the elbows. It is because Allah says, “Wash your faces and hands upto (from) the elbows.” He (Allah) then says, “Wipe your heads and feet up to your ankles.” If one wipes a part of his head and a part of the backs of his feet between his ankles, it is sufficient.’ We then asked, ‘What part of the feet is between ankles to the ends of fingers?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is here, the joint below the bones of the leg.’ We then asked, ‘What exactly is this?’ "
