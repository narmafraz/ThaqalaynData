            "3. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Bakr ibn Salih from al-Hassan ibn Ali from ’Isma‘il ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz from his father from abu Basir who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the case of a certain person of our people who has eight hundred dirham, works with pumice, and has a large family to feed, if he can receive Zakat. He (the Imam) asked, ‘O abu Muhammad, can he earn with his dirham the expenses of his family with a certain amount of saving?’ I replied, ‘Yes, he does.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘How much does he save?’ I replied, ‘I do not know.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If his saving amounts to half of his expenses, he cannot receive Zakat, but if it is less than half of his expenses, it is lawful for him to receive Zakat.’ I then asked, ‘Is there any Zakat on his assets?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, there is Zakat on his assets.’ I then asked, ‘How will he deal with it?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘With that he meets his expenses for his family, for their food, drink and clothes, and if anything remains he can give to others and what he receives from Zakat is to raise the standard of the living of his family.’” "
