            "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father and a number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid all from Muhammad ibn Khalid from Khalaf ibn Hammad and Ahmad has also narrated from Muhammad ibn Aslam from Khalaf ibn Hammad al-Kufiy who has said the following: “A certain person of our people married a girl who had not experienced menstruation. Blood discharge started after sexual relation and it did not stop for about ten days. Nurses were called to examine and they had different opinions. Certain ones of them said that it is because of Hayd (menses) and others said that it is because of virginity. They then asked scholars of their Fiqh (law), like abu Hanifah and other of their scholars of Fiqh. They said that it is a difficult issue because Salah (prayer) is an obligatory duty. She must take Wudu’, perform Salah (prayer) and keep her husband away until blood discharge stops. If in fact it is because of Hayd (menses), performing Salah (prayer) is not harmful, and if it is because of virginity, she has fulfilled her duty. She followed their instruction. I went that year for Hajj. When we were in Mina I sent someone to abu al-Hassan, Musa ibn Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, and said, pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, we have an issue which is giving us a difficult time. If you will kindly grant us an appointment, we like to present it before you for an answer.’ He (the Imam) sent a message that said, ‘When it becomes quiet, there are less feet walking, and roads become free, you can come by the will of Allah.’ Khalaf has said that at night when people’s coming and going reduced in Mina, I walked to his tent. When I was near his tent, I saw a black figure on the road who asked, ‘Who are you?’ I said, ‘I am one of the pilgrims.’ He asked, ‘What is your name?’ I replied, ‘I am Khalaf ibn Hammad.’ He said, ‘You can go inside and you do not need any more permission, because he (the Imam) had instructed me to wait here to allow you to go inside.’ I then went inside, expressed my greeting of peace to him and he (the Imam) responded to my expressing greeting of peace. He (the Imam) was sitting on the furnishing alone and there was no one in the tent beside him (the Imam). When I was in his presence I asked how he felt and he (the Imam) asked about my conditions and I said, ‘A man who is of your followers has married a girl who had not experienced Hayd (menses). After sexual relation she experienced blood discharge, which did not stop for up to ten days. Nurses examined her and they had different opinions about it. Certain ones among them said that it is because of Hayd (menses) and others said that it is because of virginity. What must she do in such condition?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She must observe piety before Allah. If it is because of Hayd (menses), she must stop performing Salah (prayer) until she is clean from Hayd (menses) and she must keep her husband away. If it is because of virginity, she must observe piety before Allah, must take Wudu’, perform Salah (prayer) and allow her husband to come to her if she so pleases.’ I (the narrator) then asked, ‘How can she find out what it is so they can follow their duty?’ He (the narrator) has that he (the Imam) looked to the left and right sides in the tent for fear of someone hearing his words. He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam) then leaned toward me and said, ‘O Khalaf, it is the secret of Allah, it is the secret of Allah, you must not publicize it and do not tell it to these people the principles of the religion of Allah. Just agree with what Allah has agreed that they follow their straying. He (the Imam) then formed the figure ninety with his left hand and said, ‘She must place a piece of cotton in her urethra and allow it gently there for a while, then gently take it out. If blood is found as a circle around the piece of cotton, it is because of her virginity; and if blood is found as penetrating (in the center) inside the cotton it is because of Hayd (menses).’ Khalaf has said, ‘I cried because of happiness and when my weeping calmed down, he (the Imam) asked, “What made you weep?”’ I replied, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, no one can give an answer better than your answer.’ He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam) raised his hand to the sky and said, ’By Allah, I only answered you from the Messenger of Allah, from Jibril from Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious.”’ "

She finds bleeding but does not know if it is because of Hayd (menses) or because of the wound and blood flows. He (the Imam) said, ‘Instruct her to lie down on her back, raise her legs and place her middle finger inside. If blood comes from the right side, it is because of Hayd (menses); if it comes from the left side, it is because of the wound.’” "
