In it he praises Allah and speaks of His glory, then advises people to observe piety (taqwa’) before Allah, reads a small Surah (chapter) from al-Quran. He then sits down, then stands up and praises Allah, speaks of His glory and says Salawat, (O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause). He prays for the Imam of the Muslims and asks forgiveness from Allah for the believers, male and female. When he completes the sermon the caller readies people for Salah (prayer) and the Imam performs Salah (prayer) of two Rak‘at. In the first Rak‘at he reads Surah (chapter) al-Jumu‘ah after al-Fatihah, and in the second Rak‘at Surah (chapter) al-Munafiqun after al-Fatihah.”’ "

            "6. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from al-Husayn ibn Sa‘id from al-Nadr ibn al-Suwayd, from Yahya al-Halabiy from Burayd ibn Mu‘awiyah from Muhammad ibn Muslim who has said the following: “In the first sermon of Friday prayer, abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said to say, ’All praise belongs to Allah. We praise Him, beg assistance from Him, ask Him for forgiveness, seek guidance from Him and seek protection with Him against the evil of our own selves and our own bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, no one can mislead and whomever Allah causes to go astray, no one is able to guide.’ “I testify that no one, other than Allah, deserves worship. He (Allah) is one, He has no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. He chose him to serve as one with His Authority, made him a special person with His message and honored him with prophesy. He (Muhammad) is the trustee with Allah’s unseen matters and is a mercy for all the worlds. O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. Servants of Allah, I advise you to observe piety before Allah and warn you of His punishment. Allah saves those who observe piety before Him to enjoy happiness. Thus, bad things cannot touch them and they do not feel sadness. Allah honors those who fear Him, protects against things from which they were afraid and allows them to experience affluence and joy. I encourage you to be interested in the grace of Allah, which is forever, I warn you of His punishment, which never ends, and there is no relief thereby for those who are subject to it. Thus, you must not allow worldly matters to deceive you and you should not rely on them; it is a dwelling of deception. Allah has deemed it and its dwellers to face destruction. Thus you must supply yourselves by the things with which Allah has honored you, in the form of observing piety and virtuous deeds; the good deeds of the servant of Allah do not receives acceptance before Allah unless they are pure and Allah does not accept (good deeds) from anyone other than the pious ones. Allah has informed you of the positions of those who believe in Him, do good deeds, and of the positions of the unbelievers of improper deeds saying, “That is the Day (of resurrection) where all people are gathered and that is the day of the presence of everyone. We delay it only for an appointed time. The day it comes not a single soul can speak without His permission. Thus, certain ones of the people are unfortunate and others are fortunate ones. The unfortunate ones are in the fire wherein they wail and cry. Therein they live forever as long as the skies and earth are there, except if your Lord wishes otherwise. Your Lord certainly, does whatever He wants. Those who are fortunate, they are in paradise wherein they live forever as long as the skies and earth are there, unless your Lord wishes otherwise, such as granting unending gifts.” (11:102-108). We pray to Allah who has brought us in this gathering to make our day a blessing and grant mercy to all of us; He has power over all things. The Book of Allah is the most truthful narration and has the best stories. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “When Quran is recited, listen to it and remain silent so that perhaps you receive mercy.” (7:203) Thereafter recite a chapter from the Holy Quran and pray to your Lord and say, “Allahumma Salli ’Ala Muhammad wa ’Ali Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause).” Pray for the believing people, male and female. Then sit down for a short while and then say: “All praise belongs to Allah. We praise Him, beg assistance from Him, and beg of Him to forgive us, seek guidance from Him, believe in Him, trust Him and seek protection with Him against the evil of our own selves and our own bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, no one can mislead and whomever Allah causes to go astray no one is able to guide.” “I testify that no one, other than Allah, deserves worship. He (Allah) is one, He has no partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. He sent him with guidance and true religion to make His religion stand supreme over all religions even though the pagans dislike, and He has made him to be a mercy for all the worlds, with glad news and warning that calls people to Allah by His permission and is a shining beacon. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, finds the right guidance and whoever disobeys becomes lost.’ “Servants of Allah I advise you to observe piety before Allah. Those who obey Allah benefit thereby and those who disobey Him suffer losses. Allah is the One in whose presence you will all return. He is the One who will judge you (for your merits). Observing piety is Allah’s advice for you and for those who lived before you. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “We advised those to whom heavenly book was given before you as well as yourselves to be pious before Allah but if you disbelieve all things in heavens and on earth belongs to Allah, Allah is self-sufficient and praiseworthy.” (4:130). “You must benefit from Allah’s advice and hold fast to His book; it has most eloquent pieces of advice and the best of things in matters of consequences. Allah has established His arguments against people. He gives them the chance not to face destruction without enough opportunity to follow proper guidance, so if they face their own destruction they face it without any excuse and those who follow guidance and live can do so with valid proofs. The Messenger of Allah has already preached the message that he brought (from Allah). You must strictly follow his will and the matters that he has left among you, in the form of two heavy issues, the book of Allah and his family. Whoever follows them (the two issues) will never go astray and those who abandon them (the two issues) will never find any guidance.’ “Allahumma Salli ‘Ala Muhammad (O Allah grant Muhammad, Your servant and messenger, the master of the messengers, the leader of the pious people, the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, and his family a compensation worthy of their serving Your cause.” Then say, “O Allah grant Ali, Amir al- Mu’minin, the executor of the will of the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, a compensation worthy of his serving Your cause.” Then mention all ’A’immah one by one up to the twelfth Imam, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, and then say, “O Allah, please, grant him easy victory and support him with a mighty support. O Lord, make through him Your religion to stand supreme as well as the Sunnah (traditions) of Your prophet, so that nothing of the truth remains hidden for fear of any creature. O Lord, we wish to live under a graceful government in which You grant might to Islam and its followers, humiliate hypocrisy and hypocrite people. In such government, make us to be the preacher to following your laws and leaders to your path. Under such government, grant us the grace of this life as well as the life to come. O Lord, make us to know fully the truth that You have made us to bear and teach us to correct our shortcomings.” “He then should pray to Allah to condemn His enemies and pray for himself and his friends. They then should raise their hands and pray to Allah for all of their wishes until it is complete and then say, “O Lord, answer our prayers.” At the end he should say, “Allah commands to practice justice and do good and to yield to the rights of relatives, and prohibits committing indecency, unlawful matters and to rebel against the truth. I give you good advice so you can be considerate.” Then say, “O Lord, make us to be of those who are reminded and such reminders have benefited them.” Then end the sermon.’” "
