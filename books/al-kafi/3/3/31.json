            "8. Sahl ibn Ziyad has narrated from ibn abu Najran from ‘Abd Allah ibn Sinan who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, if one who gives Ghusl (bath) to a dead person is required to take Ghusl (bath). He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, he is required to take Ghusl (bath).’ I then asked if one who places the deceased in the grave is required to take Ghusl (bath). He (the Imam) said, ‘No, he is not required to take Ghusl (bath) because he only touches the cloth.’” "
