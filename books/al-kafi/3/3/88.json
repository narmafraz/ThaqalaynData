Their voice sounds like thunder, their eyes like swift lightening, tearing the earth with their incisors, they strike the earth with their hairs and ask the deceased, ’Who is your Lord and what your religion is?’ The Imam then said, ‘If the deceased is a believer he will say, “Allah is my Lord and Islam is my religion.” They will then ask the deceased, “What do you say about this man who appeared among you?” The deceased will ask, “Are you asking me about Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah?” They then ask, “Do you testify that he is the Messenger of Allah?” He will say, “Yes, I do testify that he is the Messenger of Allah.” They then will say, “Rest to sleep without dreams.” They will open his grave by nine yards and a door to paradise where he can observe his seat. If the deceased is an unbeliever, the two angels will come to him and present before him will also be Satan with his eyes made of brass. The angels will ask him, “Who is your Lord, what is your religion and what do you say about this man who appeared among you?” The deceased will say, “I do not know.” The angels then leave him with Satan who then will expose him to ninety-nine such serpents that even if one of them would blow in earth, no plant thereafter can grow therein.

            "10. A number of our people have narrated from Sahl ibn Ziyad from ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn abu Najran from ‘Asem ibn Humayd from abu Basir who has said the following: ”1 heard abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say, ‘When a person is placed in his grave, two angels come to him, one from the right, the other from the left, and Satan whose eyes are made of brass stands before his eyes. The two angels will ask, “What do you say about the man who lived among you?’” The Imam then said, ‘This causes him a terrifying alarm. If a believing person, he says, “Are you asking about Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah?” The two angels will then say to him, “Rest to sleep without dreams therein.” They will make his grave spacious by nine yards. He then observes his seat in paradise.’ This is what Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has mentioned (in His Book), ‘Allah keeps the believers steadfast upon the firmly established word both in this and in the next life.’ <a href=\"/#/books/quran:14#h26\">[14:26]</a> If he is an unbeliever, the two angels will ask, “Who is the man who appeared among you?” He will say, “I do not know.” The two angels will then leave him with Satan.’” "

            "12. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from al-Husayn ibn Sa‘id from al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from Ali ibn abu Hamzah from abu Basir who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that when a believing person is taken out of his home, the angels escort him to his grave in a crowded manner until they arrive on his grave. The earth then says to him, ‘You are most welcome. By Allah, I loved that people like you walk on me. You will see what I will do for you.’ His grave will be opened up for him as far as his eyes can see, and then the two angels of grave, the dweller therein, Munkar and Nakir, enter into his grave, send his soul in him up to his loin, make him rise to sit upright and ask him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He then replies, ‘Allah is my Lord.’ They then ask, ‘What is your religion?’ He replies, ‘Islam is my religion.’ They then ask, ‘Who is your prophet?’ He then replies, ‘Muhammad is my prophet.’ They then ask, ‘Who is your Imam?’ He then replies, ‘So and so is my Imam.’ Then someone calls from the heaven, ‘My servant has told the truth. Furnish his grave from the furnishing of paradise and open for his grave a door to paradise, dress him from the dresses of paradise until he will come to Us; what is with Us for him is better.’ Then it is said to him, ‘Rest to sleep like a newly wedded person, rest sleeping without dreams.’ The Imam then said, ‘If he is an unbeliever, the angels escort him to his grave while they all condemn him until they arrive on his grave; and the earth says, “You are not welcome at all. By Allah, I hated that people like you walk on me. However, you will see what I will do to you today.” The grave then presses him with a huge force until his sides join each other. The Imam then said, ‘Then the angels of the grave, the dwellers of the grave, Munkar and Nakir, enter his grave.’ Abu Basir then asked, ‘May Allah keep my soul in your service, do they (the angels) come to the believer and the unbeliever with the same shape and form?’ The Imam replied, ‘No, they do not do so.’ The Imam then said, ‘They then make him sit upright and send his soul in him up to his loin and ask him, “Who is your Lord?” He will hesitate and say, “I heard people say (so and so).” They will say, “May you never know.” They then will ask, “What is your religion?” He will hesitate. They will say, “May you never know.” They will ask, “Who is your prophet?” He will say, “I heard people say (so and so).” They will say, “May you never know.” They then will ask him about the Imam of his time? The Imam then said, ‘Someone from the heaven then calls saying, “My servant has lied. Furnish his grave with the furnishing of fire, dress him with the dress of fire, open for him a door to fire until he comes before Us and what is with Us for him is much worse.” They then strike him with a war-club three times and each strike sets his grave on fire. The force of each strike can turn the mountains of Makkah into ashes? The Imam then said, ‘Allah then allows serpents to bite him repeatedly and Satan to make him suffer sadness? The Imam also said, ‘All creatures of Allah except man and Jinn hear his punishment. He can hear the sound of their shoes walking and the sound of their fingers being cracked and this is what Allah has mentioned in His book, “Allah keeps the believers steadfast upon the firmly established word in this world and in the next life and Allah causes to mislead the unjust and He does as He wills?”” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:14#h26\">[14:26]</a> "
