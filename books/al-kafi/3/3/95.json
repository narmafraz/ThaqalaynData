And he<sup>asws</sup> was reclining, so he<sup>asws</sup> sat upright, then said: ‘The evil-doer, may the Curse of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> be upon him. Al-Mugheira Bin Abu Al-A’as, his uncle sheltered him, and he was from the ones Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> permitted his<sup>saww</sup> blood to be spilled (killed).

So he made him (the evil-doer) to be inside a cupboard of his and wrapped him in a velvet cloth. So Revelation came to Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup>, and he<sup>saww</sup> was informed of his (hiding) place. So he<sup>saww</sup> sent Ali<sup>asws</sup> to him and said: ‘Wrap up upon your<sup>asws</sup> sword, go to the house of the daughter of your cousin, and if you get hold of Al-Mugheira, so kill him’.

            "So when it was the fourth time, he<sup>saww</sup> said: ‘Will you leave or shall I<sup>saww</sup> mention his name?’ So Usman came over leaning upon a slave of his, holding his belly, and he said, ‘O Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup>! I complain of my bellyache. So if you<sup>saww</sup> see fit, permit me to leave’. He<sup>saww</sup> said: ‘Leave!’ And Syeda Fatima<sup>asws</sup> came out, and the womenfolk of the Believers, and the Emigrants, so they prayed <span class=\"iTxt\">Salaat</span> upon the deceased’."

He went to prophet Idris and requested him saying, “You have a great position before Allah, please intercede for me before your Lord.” He prayed for three nights without lapse, fasted three days without break and then pleaded before Allah, the Most High in an early morning about the angel and the angel said, “You have been granted your request and my wing is freed. I would like to compensate you for this favor. You may ask me for help if you need.” He said, “If you can show me the angel of death, you may do so, so that I try to get comfortable with him because, on remembering him nothing seems enjoyable to me.” The angel spread his wing and said, “Climb on” and he ascended up in search for the angel of death in heaven above the world. He was told to ascend higher. They met him between the fourth and the fifth heavens, and the angel asked, “Why is it that I see you, O angel of death, frowning?” He replied, “It is strange. I, while under the shadow of the Throne, am commanded to remove the soul of a man between the fourth and the fifth heavens.” Idris heard it, he found it very difficult and fell off the wing of the angel. His soul was removed from his body at the spot. About this Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “We raised him to a high (exalted) place <a href=\"/#/books/quran:19#h65\">[19:65]</a>.’”” "
