There is a man who has learned the Holy Quran, preserved its letters, but has lost its laws. He has kept its letters without change. (I wish) Allah would not increase the number of people like him as the carrier of the Holy Quran. ‘‘There is a man who has applied the medicine of the Holy Quran to the wounds of his heart, it keeps him vigilant during the night, he endures thirst during the day, stands up in mosques and leaves his bed for its (the Holy Quran) sake.

This servant (of Allah) would stand on us and read Surah al-Mulk everyday and night. ’ When they try to enter his grave from the middle section his middle section will say, ‘You cannot enter from my side of the grave.
