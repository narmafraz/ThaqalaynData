Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from Jamil ibn Darraj from Zurara who has said the following: “Once I asked abu Ja’far (a.s.) ‘What do you say about a man who does a good deed while a human being sees him and it makes him happy?’ The Imam said, ‘There is no offense in it. There is no one who does not love people seeing something good come from him even though he may not have done it for such purposes (people see him doing good).”’ "
