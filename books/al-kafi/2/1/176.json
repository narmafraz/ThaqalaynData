Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, commanded His Holy Prophet to attract them with financial means and gifts so that their Islam may improve and they remain steadfast in their religion which they had just accepted and professed. ’ “On the day of Hunayn (a battle field) the Messenger of Allah had a meeting with leaders of Arabs from Quraysh, and others from the tribe of Mudar. Among such people were abu Sufyan ibn Harb, ‘Uyaynah ibn Hasin al-Farazi and other such people. The Ansar, people of Madina, became angiy and gathered around Sa’d ibn ‘Ubadah. He went with them to see the Messenger of Allah at al-Ja’ranah. He asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, can I speak?’ He said, ‘Yes, you may speak.’ He said, ‘If the case of these goods that you have distributed among your tribesmen is something that has come from Allah, we agree, and if it is something else, we do not agree.’ Zurara has said, ‘I heard abu Ja’far saying, “The Messenger of Allah asked, ‘O people of Ansar, are all of you of the opinion of your master Sa’d?’” They said, ‘Our master is Allah and the Messenger of Allah.’ Then they said at the third time, ‘We are of the same opinion and words.’ Zurara has said, ‘I heard abu Ja’far (a.s.) saying, “For this reason Allah decreased the light of their belief and assigned a share for people of inclined hearts in the Holy Quran.’” "
