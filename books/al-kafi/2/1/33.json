He said, ‘So have you done anything from this (adultery) before?’ She said, ‘No, by His<sup>azwj</sup> Honour’. He said, ‘So you are being scared from Him<sup>azwj</sup> by this fright and you have not done anything from this (before), and rather I am coercing you with a coercion. So (now), by Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, I am closer with this fright and the fear, and more deserving than you (of being scared)’.",

Once he was walking (on a path) when he came across a priest walking in the street. The sun was bright upon the two of them, and the priest said to the youth (once the robber), ‘Supplicate to Allah<sup>azwj</sup> to Shade us with a cloud, for the sun is too hot upon us’. So the youth said, ‘I do not know of a (single) good deed which is with my Lord<sup>azwj</sup>, so it would be too audacious of me to ask Him<sup>azwj</sup> for anything’. ",

So they both walked under it careful during the day. Then their ways separated into two, and the youth took to one, and the priest took to the other. So the cloud (went) with the youth. So the priest said, ‘You are better than I am. For you it (the supplication) was Answered and it was not Answered for me. So inform me what your story is. So he informed him of the news of the woman. So he said, ‘There has been Forgiveness for you what is past (from the sins) when the fear entered into you, therefore consider how you want to be in the future’’."

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from al- Hassan ibn al-Husayn from Muhammad ibn Sinan from abu Sa’id al-Makari from abu Hamza al-Thumali from Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) who has said the following: “A man once set sail with his people and suffered a shipwreck. Everyone on board died except his wife who clung to a board and landed on an island where there lived a robber who had left no instance of disobedience to Allah but had committed them all. Without knowing anything about the shipwreck he found the woman standing over his head. He raised his head and asked her, ‘Are you a human being or a Jinni?’ She replied, ‘I am a human being. ’ He then did not say any other word but began to behave like a husband. When he advanced for a carnal relation she panicked. He asked, ‘Why have you panicked?’ She said, ‘I am afraid of this, pointing to the heavens.’ He then asked, ‘Have you done any such thing wrong against Him?’ She said, ‘No, I swear by His Glory that I have not done any such thing against Him.’ He then said, ‘You fear Him this much when you have done nothing against Him and it is only I that force you into this. In fact, I swear by Allah, I am the one who must be afraid of Him more so than you are.’ The robber then moved away without speaking a word and went back to his family. He then had no other aim but to repent and return to Allah. Once as he was walking on the road, a monk joined him walking in the same direction. The day was hot and the monk suggested that they should pray to Allah to send them a piece of cloud to provide shade against the hot sun. The young man (once a robber) said, ‘I do not think I have any good deed with my Lord so I dare not pray to Him.’ The monk said, ‘I pray and you say, Amen.’ He agreed and the monk began to pray and the young man said the Amen part. Quickly a piece of cloud appeared and provided them a shadow. They walked comfortably under the shadow against the sun. The road then divided and the young man walked in one road and the monk in the other one. The shadow went along over the young man. The monk said, ‘You are better than me. The prayer was accepted because of you, not because of me. Now tell me what is your story?’ The young man told him the story of the woman. The monk said, ‘Your sins of the past are forgiven because of fear that entered in your heart. Pay proper attention to your future behaviors.’” "
