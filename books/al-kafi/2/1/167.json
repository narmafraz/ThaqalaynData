            "And the immorality is upon four branches – upon the disloyalty, and the blindness, and the heedlessness, and the insolence. So the one who was disloyal would consider the truth as insignificant and would detest the understanding ones<sup>asws</sup>, and insist upon committing the grievous sins. And the one who is blind would forget the Remembrance (of Allah<sup>azwj</sup>) and follow the conjectures and duel against his Creator, and the Satan<sup>la</sup> would urge upon him, and he would seek the Forgiveness without repenting, and he would neither be complacent nor be heedless. ",
            "And the one who is heedless would perpetrate against himself and overturn upon his back and reckon that his straying is a guidance, and the wishful thinking deceives him, and the regret and remorse seizes him when the matter is accomplished and the covering is uncovered from him, and there appears to him what he had not reckoned with; and the one who is insolent about the Commands of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> would doubt, and the one who doubts, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Overcomes upon him and Disgraces him with His<sup>azwj</sup> Authority, and Belittles him by His<sup>azwj</sup> Majesty just as he had deceived with his Benevolent Lord<sup>azwj</sup> and exceeded in His<sup>azwj</sup> Commands.",
            "And the exaggeration is upon four branches – upon the diving into the opinions, and the disputing in it, and the aberrations and the discord. So the one who dives (into the opinions) would not be reprimanded to the Truth and would not increase except in drowning in the immersions, and a strife would not recede from him except that another one would overwhelm him, and his religion would be punctured (demolished), so he would tumble into a confusing affair. ",
            "And the one who disputes regarding the opinions and quarrels, would be exposed by the absurdities from the prolonged obstinacy. So the one who is disloyal, the good deeds would seem terrible to him and the evil deeds would appear good to him. And the one who is troublesome, his ways would be dead-ended, and his affairs would be protested upon him. Thus, his exit would be constricted upon him when he does not follow the way of the <span class=\"iTxt\">Momineen</span>’.  ",
            "And the doubt is upon four branches – upon the suspicion, and the whims, and the hesitation, and the submission, and these are the Words of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic <span class=\"ibTxt\">[53:55] Which of your Lord's benefits will you then be suspicious about?</span>’. ",
            "And in another report, ‘(The doubt) is upon the suspicions, and the awe from the Truth, and the hesitation, and the submission to the ignorance and its people’. ",
            "So the one who is terrified of what is in front of him would turn back upon his heels, and the one who suspects in the Religion would hesitate in the doubts, and the former ones from the <span class=\"iTxt\">Momineen</span> would precede him and the later ones would catch up with him, and he would be trampled under the hooves of the Satans<sup>la</sup>; and the one who submits to the destruction of the world and the Hereafter would  be destroyed in what is between the two, and the one who is saved from that is by the merit of the conviction.

            "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Ibrahim ibn ‘Umar al-Yamani from ‘Umar ibn ‘Udhaynah from Aban ibn abu ‘Ayyash from Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali from Amir al-Mu’minin, Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) who has said the following: “Disbelief is established on four pillars: Sinfulness, Extremism, Doubt and Skepticism. Sinfulness has four branches: harshness of manners, blindness of heart, neglect, and arrogance. Whoever behaves in a harsh manner belittles the truth, hates the people of profound understanding and persists in great sins. Whoever becomes blind of heart forgets to remember (the truth), follows guesses, opposes his Creator and Satan turns bold toward him. He asks forgiveness without repenting, feeling humble and without being unaware of sin. Whoever is neglectful and careless commits a crime against his own soul, turns himself upside down and thinks of his misguidance as guidance. Yearnings deceives him, remorse and pangs of guilt seize him and when the matters settle and the curtain is raised, he finds it to be what he did not expect. Whoever is arrogant to obey the commands of Allah doubts and whoever doubts, Allah overpowers him and humiliates him by His Authority and makes him little by His Glory as he has played deceit against his Honorable Lord and has gone to extremes in his affairs. “Extremism is of four branches: Seeking profundity of opinion, disputation over an opinion, looking for deviations in it and creating a schism therein. “Whoever seeks extreme complexity he does not return to the truth, and does not gain anything except sinking in deeper troubles. He does not finish removing one before another trouble overwhelms him. His religion sustains holes and he falls deeper in chaos. Whoever seeks disputation in an opinion and quarrels, his absurdity comes in the open due to prolonged controversy. Whoever deviates, goodness seems terrible to him and evil begins to look lovelier. “Whoever creates a schism, his paths lead to dead end, his affairs burden him, his escape narrows if he would not follow the path of the believers. “Doubt is of four branches: Suspicion, desire, hesitation and submission. It is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, ‘About which of the bounties of your Lord can they persistently dispute and cast doubts?’ (53:55) “In another Hadith it is said, ‘It branches in suspicion, fear of truth, hesitation and submission before ignorance and ignorant people.’ “Whoever fears what is before him turns back. Whoever is suspicious of religion remains hesitant in doubts and the foremost believing people move forward before him and those behind catch up with him. He turns out to be flattened under the hooves of Satan. Whoever submits to worldly destruction and that of the next life is destroyed between the two. Whoever is saved from such condition is due to the excellence of certainty. Allah has not created any creature fewer than certainty. “Casting doubt is of four branches: a liking of attractiveness, stimulation of soul, interpretation of crookedness and mixing of truth with falsehood. “This is because attractiveness clashes with evidence, stimulation of soul indulges in desires and crookedness bends its companion a great bent. Hiding and mixing truth with falsehood is darkness upon darkness. That is disbelief, its pillars and branches.’” "
