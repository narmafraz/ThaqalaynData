I swear by the One besides Whom no one else deserves to be worshipped that, hope of a believer does not exist without Allah running his affairs according to the hopeful intentions of the believer. It is because nobility is of the attributes of Allah; in His hand is all good, and He considers Himself indebted toward His believing servants, who are hopeful about Him, not to allow their hope remain fruitless.
