It is narrated from him (narrator of the Hadith above) from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from certain individuals of our people from Safwan al-Jammal who has said the following: “Once I was in the presence of abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) when a man from the people of Makkah called Maymun came in and complained to him about his difficulty paying his rent. The Imam said to me, ‘Stand up and help your brother (in belief).’ I then left with him and Allah facilitated payment for his rent and I returned to the assembly. Abu ‘Abd Allah asked, ‘What did you do for your brother (in belief)?’ I said, ‘Allah facilitated it for him, may Allah keep the souls of my parents in service for your cause.’ The Imam said, ‘Your help to your Muslim brother (in belief) is more beloved to me than performing Tawaf (walking seven times around the Ka’ba for worship) around the House.’ The Imam said it on his own initiation. Then the Imam said, ‘Once a man came to al- Hassan ibn Ali (a.s.) and said, “May Allah keep the souls of my parents in service for your cause, 1 need help with a certain matter.” He put on his shoes and left with him. They passed by al-Husayn ibn Ali (a.s.) where he was standing in prayer and he (al-Hassan) asked the man, ‘Did you ask abu ‘Abd Allah for help?’ The man said, ‘May Allah keep my soul in service for your cause, I already have done so and abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) said that he was in ‘I’tikaf (a certain form of worship).’ Al-Hassan (a.s.) said, ‘Had he helped you (were he not in T’tikaf), it would have been better for him than T’tikaf for a whole month.’” "
