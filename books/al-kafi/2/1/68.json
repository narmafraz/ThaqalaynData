Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from certain individuals of his people from ‘Amr ibn Shamir from Jabir from abu Ja’far (a.s.) who has said the following: “When Amir al-Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) left Madina for Basra, on his way he stopped at al-Rabadhah (a place near Jaddah). A man from Muharib (a tribe) came and said, ‘O Amir al-Mu’minin, I have been shouldering many responsibilities for my people and I have asked quite a few of them to help and cooperate with me, instead they have been very harsh to me. O Amir al-Mu’minin, command them to help me and encourage them to cooperate with me.’ The Imam asked, ‘Where are they?’ He said, ‘Those are a few of them as you may see.’ The man has said, ‘The Imam directed his horse to their direction, which began to move faster than trudge. Certain men from his companions followed, but they had difficulty catching up with him, and he would slow down for them until he reached the people and offered them greetings of peace. He asked them about their lack of cooperation with one of their own people. They complained before the Imam and he complained against them. Amir al- Mu’minin (Ali ibn abu Talib) (a.s.) said, ‘A man must maintain good relations with relatives; they are more deserving of benefitting from his virtuous deeds and achievements. The relatives must maintain good relations with one of their own in times of need when things are against him. Those who maintain good relations with relatives and help financially are rewarded. Those who cut off good relations with relatives and turn away commit a sin.’ The man has said, ‘The Imam then turned his horse around and directed it to move.’” "

Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Ali ibn al-Hakam from Safwan al-Jammal who has said the following: “Once a conversation took place between abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) and ‘Abd Allah ibn al- Hassan and it had become quite noisy and people had gathered around. They departed from each other that evening. The next morning I was out for a task and I saw abu ‘Abd Allah (a.s.) at the door of ‘Abd Allah ibn al- Hassan who was saying, ‘O girl, tell abu Muhammad to come out.’ He came out and said, ‘O abu ‘Abd Allah what has made you come out this early?’ He replied, ‘Last night I read a verse of the book of Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, and it worried me.’ He asked, ‘Which verse is it?’ He said, ‘It is the words of Allah, Most Glorious, Most Majestic is Whose mention, “. . . who maintain all the proper relations that Allah has commanded them to maintain, who have fear of their Lord and the hardships of the Day of Judgment,” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:13#h21\">[13:21]</a> He said, ‘You have spoken the truth. It seems I have never come across this verse in the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy.’ They both wept and hugged each other.’” "
