When he found that Allah did not answer his prayer, he then asked, ‘O Lord, am I far away from You and You do not hear me or You are close to me but do not answer me?’ The Imam said, ‘Someone came in his dream and said, ‘You have prayed to Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, for three years in an obscene language, with an oppressive heart that is impious and with untrue intentions. Stay away from obscenity, be pious before Allah and make your intention to be good.’ The Imam said, ‘The man followed the instruction, and prayed to Allah, only then a son was born to him. ’” "
