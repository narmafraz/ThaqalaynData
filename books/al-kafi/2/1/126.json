It has many branches, and the sins have branches also. The first sin committed was Arrogance, the sin of Satan, when he refused to obey (Allah), assumed arrogance and became an unbeliever. Thereafter it is Greed, the sin of Adam and Eve. When Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Holy, told them, ‘Enjoy the foods therein, but do not go near a certain tree lest you become of the transgressors.’ (2:35) They took what they did not need and it remained in their descendents to the Day of Judgment. For this reason most of the things that the children of Adam want do not need them. Thereafter is Envy. It is the sin of the son of Adam who envied his brother and killed him. From this branches love for women, love for the world, love to become the leader, the love to be comfortable, the love to speak, the love to be superior and rich. They total seven characteristics and all are found in the love for the world. The prophets and the scholars after knowing this have said, ‘Love for the world is the head of all sins.’ The world is of two kinds: The world of bare necessities and the condemned one.’” "
