He milked them and poured it from his milk container altogether in the container for the Messenger of Allah. Along with all the milk he also sent a sheep for him, saying, ‘This is what we have and we can bring you more if you like.’ The Imam said, ‘The Messenger of Allah prayed for him, “O Lord, give him sustenance adequate only for his bare necessities.” A certain man of his companion then asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, how is it that you prayed for the shepherd who refused to give you any milk in such a way that we all love. However, for the one who readily provided what you asked, you prayed for him with a prayer that we all dislike?’ The Messenger of Allah said, ‘The little thing that is adequate is better than a great deal that diverts one’s mind (from Allah).
