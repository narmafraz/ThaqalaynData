Only in my heart, I said, ‘O Lord, make the right to be on his side.’ When they presented their case, the right was on the side of your brother, which I saw clearly in the rules of judgment. Just for what I said in my heart I face the suffering that shocked you even though it was in accordance with the truth.’” "
