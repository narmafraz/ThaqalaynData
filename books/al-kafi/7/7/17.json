He offered Salam (the phrase of offering greeting of peace), sat down, wept and said, I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause. I made a covenant with Allah that if He gives me recovery from my illness because of which I was afraid for my life, to give in charity all of my belongings and Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, granted me recovery from the illness. I have moved my family from my house to a ruined dome of al-Ansar (people of al- Madinah). I have carried all of my belongings and I am selling my house and all that I own to give them in charity.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘Go and appraise your house, all of your assets and belongings for a fair price and make it certain. Thereafter find a white sheet and write on it all that you have appraised, then find the most trustworthy person known to you among people arround you, then give the sheet to him and make a will. Instruct him that if something happened to you (death), to sell your house and all that belongs to you and give in charity on your behalf. Thereafter move back to your house to live as before with your family and maintain your family as before, but make a list of what you spend and pay as charity, or gifts to relatives or for good causes, write them down all and calculate them. At the end of the year go to the executor of the will you have made and instruct him to deduct from the total on the list what you have spent as such for charity as mentioned in that year. Thereafter, every year you must do the same things until you fulfill all of what you had committed to do for Allah in the form of vow and commitment. In this way your house will remain for you as well as your other assets, if Allah so wills.’ The man then said, ‘You have released me from my entanglement, O child of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause.’” "

She vowed for Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic regarding one of her children with regards to something which she had feared over him, that she would be Fasting on that day which had come upon her, for as long as she lived. So she went out with use to Makkah. So that was confusing upon us, for her to be Fasting during the journey. So she did not know when she should be Fasting or breaking it. So I asked Abu Ja’far<sup>asws</sup> about that, so he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘She should not Fast during the journey. Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic has Placed (dropped) it from her, being her right in the journey, and she should be Fasting what she had made it to be upon herself’. So I said to him<sup>asws</sup>, ‘So what would be that when the day comes and she leaves that?’ He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘No! I<sup>asws</sup> fear that she would see in her child that which she had vowed regarding it, some of what she had left’."

            "24. Ali has narrated from his father from ibn Mahbub from ibn Ri’ab from Zurarah who has narrated the following: “My mother had made a vow and commitment. She had made a commitment for Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, about one of her children because of fear of something for him. She said that from that day on, she will fast all the time as long as she lives. She came out with us to Makkah, her fasting on the journey made us face questions, and she did not know if she must fast or not. I asked abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about it and he (the Imam) said, ‘She must not fast on a journey. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, has exempted her from His right during a journey; but she must fast otherwise for what she has committed herself to.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if she ignores her commitment? He (the Imam) said, ‘No, I fear that she may experience in her child that which made her to form such commitment.’” "
