Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Faddal from al-Hassan ibn al-Jahm who has narrated the following: “I once asked abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the case of a man who dies and I owe him a certain amount of money. He has left behind children, male, female, and smaller children. One of them once came to me and said, ‘You are free of the responsibility of what you owed to my father as much as my share is concerned and you are also free about the shares of my brothers and sister. I take the responsibility to obtain their agreement in your favor. He (the Imam) said, ‘You are relieved and you are free of responsibility.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if he did not give them?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is his responsibility.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if the heirs come to me and ask for payment of their rights?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘According to the way the case appears they can do so but between you and Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, you are free from all responsibility toward them, when the man who has taken upon himself to obtain their agreement to what he has done, and he carries the responsibility for you.’ I then asked if a mother can take such responsibility for her child.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, it can happen if she has something with which she can make him agree.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if she does not have anything? He (the Imam) said, ‘It then is negative.’ I then said, ‘I have heard you saying that her waving is permissible.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘What I meant thereby is that if she has assets.’ I then asked, ‘Can a father take such responsibility for his son?’ He (the Imam) said to him, ‘We had no difficulty with abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He (the Imam) would do whatever he wanted.’ I then said, ‘The man has taken the responsibility for me about the right of the child and about his share. Am I free from responsibility if the man dies before the child becomes mature and he does not owe anything?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is permissible according to the condition he has undertaken for you.’” "
