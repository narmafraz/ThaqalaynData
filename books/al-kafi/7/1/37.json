A man gives him one thousand dirham to buy a slave and set him free on his behalf, perform al-Hajj on his behalf with the remainder of the asset. The owner of one thousand dirham dies and the slave buys his father, sets him free on behalf of the deceased, and gives the remaining asset to him to perform al-Hajj for the deceased, which he performs for him. However, then the masters of his father, his own masters and the heirs of the deceased learn about it who all dispute about the one thousand dirham, for which the masters of slave say, ‘You have bought your father with our funds.’ The masters of his father says, ‘You have bought your father with our funds.’ The heirs of the deceased say, ‘You have bought your father with our funds.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Al-Hajj is completed and it does not return, but the freed slave goes back to slavery of the masters of his father and whichever of the two group presents testimony that the slave has bought his father with their funds, he becomes their slave.’” "
