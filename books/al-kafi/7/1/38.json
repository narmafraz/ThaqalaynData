He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, it is so.’ “I asked him (the Imam) about a man who accompanies a man on a journey, then the incident of death over takes him and he does not get a chance to make a will and how to deal with his assets. He has small and adult children, if it is permissible to give his assets and stumper to his grown-up children or to a judge. If he is in a place where there is no judge what must he do. If he gives his assets to his adult children but did not inform them and when he went, he could not return it what must he do? He (the Imam) said, ‘When the small children grow up and cannot get their assets back in any way but by the command of Sultan (they can do so). “I asked him (the Imam) about the case of a man who dies without a will and leaves behind heirs who are small ones as well as adults if it is lawful to buy his servants and goods without the supervision of the judge. The judge supervises with the consent of the parties involved, but without the instruction from the Khalifah, if buying is good or not. He (the Imam) said, ‘If the adults of his children are with him (judge) during the sale, then it is not harmful if the heirs agree to the sale and justice is maintained in it.’” "
