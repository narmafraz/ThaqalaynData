            "8. Humayd ibn Ziyad has narrated from al-ffassan ibn Muhammad from Ja‘far ibn Sama‘ah and Ali ibn Khalid al-‘A’quliy from Karram from ibn Muskan from abu Basir who has narrated the following: “About the case of a man who forms Mula ‘anah against his wife and denies her child, then calls himself a liar after forming Mula ‘anah and thinks that the child is his child; if the child can be returned to him, abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘The child is returned to him. The child is not called his child, he does not leave any legacy for him (father) and the woman is not lawful for him forever.’ I then asked him (the Imam) about who inherits the child. He (the Imam) said, ‘His maternal uncles inherit him.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if the child’s mother dies and the child inherits her, then the child dies: who then inherits him?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The relatives of his mother inherit him.’ I then asked, ‘Can he inherit his maternal uncles? He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, he can do so.’” "
