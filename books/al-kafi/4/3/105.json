            "6. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Sahl ibn Ziyad from ibn Mahbub from ibn Ri’ab from Humran ibn ‘A’yan who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about a man who is required to perform Tawaf al- Nisa’ alone. He performs five times walking around the House, then he feels trouble in his stomach and fears its getting out of his control; so he goes to his lodging and after relieving himself becomes involved in sexual intercourse with his slave-girl. He (the Imam) said, ‘He must do Ghusl (bath), then go complete Tawaf around the House twice to complete what was left, and ask Allah to forgive him and must not repeat. If he has made three times walking around the House for Tawaf al-Nisa’, then goes and becomes involved in sexual intercourse his al-Hajj is destroyed, he owes one badanah; he takes Ghusl (bath) then goes to perform Tawaf of seven times, walking around the House.”’ "

He (the Imam) said, ‘His al-Hajj is destroyed, he owes one badanah. He must do Ghusl (bath), go back to perform Tawaf of seven times, then perform Sa‘y between al- Safa’ and al-Marwah and ask his Lord for forgiveness.’ I asked, ‘Why is there not anything on him when he performs sexual intercourse with his wife before completing Sa‘y of seven times walking for complete Sa‘y, as he owes one offering because of his sexual intercourse with his wife before completing Tawaf? He (the Imam) said, ‘Tawaf is obligatory and there is Salat (prayer) with it. Sa‘y is of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. I then said, ‘Has Allah not said, “Al-Safa’ and al-Marwah are of the reminders of Allah?”’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, He has done so, there are also these words of Allah (to consider), “If one volunteers goodness he will find Allah appreciative and all-Knowing.” Had Sa‘y been obligatory He would not say, “Those who volunteer”.”’ "
