Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father and Ali ibn Muhammad al-Qasaniy all from al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from Sulayman ibn Dawud al-Minqariy from Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that a man once asked my father after returning from al- Mawqaf, ‘Do you think Allah will leave all these creatures in hopeless condition?’ My father said, ‘Whoever stays in this station, Allah forgives them, regardless of their being believers or unbelievers. However, forgiveness for them is of three kinds. There is forgiveness in favor of a believer of his past and future sins and his freedom from fire as is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Lord, grant us goodness in this word, grant us goodness in the next life and protect us against the torment of the fire. These will have a share of what they have done and Allah is quick in accounting.” (2:200-201) There are those of them whose past sins Allah forgives. He has said, “Do good in the rest of your life.” Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Those of them who leave earlier during the two days have not committed any sins. Those who leave after the two days also have not committed any sins,” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:2#h203\">[2:203]</a> meaning those who die before leaving have not committed any sins and those who leave later have not committed any sins if they maintain piety in the matters of major sins. Muslims in general (non-Shi`a) say, “Those who leave during the two days have not committed any sins, meaning leaving Mina’ with the first departing people, and those who leave later have not committed any sins, meaning they have not committed any sins if they maintain piety in the matter of hunting.” Do you think Allah prohibits hunting after making it lawful as is mentioned in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “When you are free of the restrictions of Ihram you may hunt.” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:5#h3\">[5:3]</a> It is in the interpretations of non-Shi`a Muslims that when you are free of the restrictions of Ihram you must not hunt. “There is the unbeliever who has attended al-Mawqaf (station of the pilgrims) for worldly reasons. Allah forgives his past sins, if he repents from the sin of paganism for his future. He will receive his reward and he will not be left hopeless of the reward of his staying at this station if he does not commit any sins. This is said in the worlds of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Those who want the worldly life and its ornaments We recompense them for their deeds in this world and will not suffer any loss therein. They will not have anything in the next life except fire. Their deeds will become void and their deeds will turn into falsehood.’”” (11:15-16) "
