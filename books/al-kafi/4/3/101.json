So when it would be the day of the sacrifice, so let him shorten (hair) from his head, and the shaving is not Obligated upon him until the rituals are fulfilled.

            "3. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr and Muhammad ibn ‘Isma‘il has narrated from al-Fadl ibn Shadhan from ibn abu ‘Umayr and Safwan from Mu‘awiyah ibn ‘Ammar who has said the following: “I once heard abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, saying, ‘Al-Mahsur (confined) is different from al- Masdud (prevented). Al-Mahsur (confined) is one who suffers from an illness, and al-Masdud (prevented) is one who is prevented by the pagans, as they prevented the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and his companions. It was not because of illness. Women are lawful for al-Masdud (prevented) but not for al- Mahsur (confined).’ I then asked him (the Imam) about a man who is al-Mahsur (confined) and sends the offering. He (the Imam) said, ‘They set up a time. If it is for al-Hajj, the time for offering is the Yawm al-Nahr (day of offering). On the day of offering one does Taqsir (cutting some hair from his head) and shaving is not obligatory until all acts of al-Hajj are complete. If it is for al-‘Umrah, one waits until his people enter Makkah and at the hour which is set up, he does Taqsir (cutting some hair or finger nails and so on) and comes out of the state of Ihram. If he suffers from an illness on the way after assuming the state of Ihram, if he wants to return to his family, he can do so and slaughters a badanah (camel), or stay where he is until he gets well, if it is in al-‘Umrah when he gets well; he must perform an obligatory al-‘Umrah. If he owes al-Hajj, returns or stays there but he has missed al- Hajj and he owes al-Hajj in future. Al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, once went for al-‘Umrah and became ill on the way. Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, was informed about him in al-Madinah. He came out to find him and he found him suffering from illness in al-Suqya’ (name of a place). He asked, ‘Son what is the matter?’ He replied, ‘I have a headache.’ Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, asked for a badanah (camel), slaughtered it, shaved his head and sent him to al-Madinah. When he became well from his illness he returned for al-‘Umrah.’ I then asked, ‘When he became well and before performing al-‘Umrah were women lawful for him?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘No, women are not lawful until he performs Tawaf around the House and Tawaf between al-Safa’ and al-Marwah.’ I then asked, ‘How is it that the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, returned from al-Hudaybiyah, women were lawful for him and he had not performed Tawaf around the House?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘They are not the same. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, was al-Masdud (prevented), and al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, was al-Mahsur (confined).”’ "

            "9. Al-Nadr ibn Suwayd has narrated from al-Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn Sama‘ah from Ahmad ibn al-Hassan al-Mithamiy from Aban from Zurarah who has said the following: “Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Al-Masdud (prevented) offers an animal for slaughtering wherever he is prevented and returns home. Women are lawful for him. Al-Mahsur (confined) sends his offering, sets up a certain time and when the offering reaches its place, he in his place comes out of the state of Ihram.’ I then asked, ‘What happens if they returned dirham and did not slaughter, but he has come out of the state of Ihram and has gone with women? He (the Imam) said, ‘He must do it again; there is nothing on him but for now he must stay away from women when he sends his offering.’” "
