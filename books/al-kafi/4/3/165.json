            "4. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father and Muhammad ibn Isma‘il from al-Fadl ibn Shadhan from ibn abu ‘Umayr and Safwan ibn Yahya from Mu‘awiyah ibn ‘Ammar who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that you should stay toward the left side of the hill; the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, stayed on the left side of the hill in ‘Arafat. When he stopped, people then began to move close to him on the footsteps of his camel to stand next to him. He moved his camel and so also did the people, and he then said, ‘O people, the place to stay here is not limited to where my camel has set foot. In fact, this entire place is for staying;’ he pointed with his hand toward the whole area. He did the same thing in al-Muzdalifah. ‘If you find a vacant space, fill it up with yourself and transporting animal. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, loves that all of these places be filled up. Move away from the hillside and al-Arak.’ When you stay in ‘Arafat then praise Allah, speak of His Lordship, glory and praise. Say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) one hundred times. Read Chapter 112 of the Holy Quran one hundred times. Choose for yourself whatever prayers you like. Strive hard; it is the day for prayer and appeal for help (before Allah). Seek protection with Allah against Satan; Satan does not become tired in a place where he loves to make you feel tired (of praying). You should avoid looking at people. Come to yourself, and of the things you say should be this, “O Allah, Lord of all of al-Mash’a‘ir (things that remind one of Allah), set me free of hellfire, increase my sustenance of the lawful kind and keep away from me the wickedness of sinful Jinn and man. O Allah, do not plan against me, or prepare slippery conditions and do not lead me gradually to destruction. You listen to appeals better than all of those who listen. You are the best observer of those who observe, the swiftest of those who prepare accounts and the best of those who grant mercy. I appeal before You O Allah, to grant salawat (favors and compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause), make so and so of my wishes to come true.” Of the prayer you may say should be this when you raise your hands to the sky, “O Allah, my wishes are such ones that if You grant them, whatever You deny will not harm me and if You deny whatever You have granted me will not benefit me. I appeal before You to set me free from hellfire. O Allah, I am Your servant, of the things that You own and the control of my forehead is in Your hand, and You know the time of my death. I appeal before You to grant me the opportunity to do whatever pleases You with me. Accept the acts of my al-Hajj that I have performed following the instructions that you had given to Ibrahim Your friend and have showed them to Your beloved one, Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause.” In your prayers you should include this, “O Allah, make me of those with whose deeds You are happy, who are granted long life, and a beautiful life after death.’”” "
