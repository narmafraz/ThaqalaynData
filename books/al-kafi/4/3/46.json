No one, except Allah, the most High, the most Great, deserves worship.

O Allah, keep our supplies in good condition, place blessings in the sustenance You have granted us and protect us against the hellfire. O Allah, I seek protection with You against fatigue during my journey, sadness during my return, evil appearance with my possession and before my family. O Allah, from You is my power and support.

O Allah, reduce for me the length of this journey and its hardships, be my Companion during this journey and my Deputy in my family with goodness. There is no means and power except the means and power of Allah. O Allah, I am Your servant, this is Your transporting animal, the direction, the journey is toward You, and You have information about matters, which no one beside You has. Make this journey an expiation for my sins that I have committed before this journey. Be my supporter during this journey and suffice for me its fatigue and hardships. Dictate to me the words and deeds that make You happy; I am Your servant with You and for You.’ When you place your foot in the stirrup of the saddle say, ‘In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, in the name of Allah and Allah is great beyond description.’ When you are in place on the saddle and have taken your place in the carriage say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah who guided us to al-Islam, taught us the Quran and has bestowed upon us Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause.
