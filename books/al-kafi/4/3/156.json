In case meeting was not convenient, he would remain there until he came out, to give him permission.’ I then asked, ‘Where is that place?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘It is under al-Mizab. When you come to the door called door of Fatimah next to the grave and upon raising your head, you see al- Mizab right above your head and the door is behind you. She should sit at that place and women behind her. She should pray to her Lord and women behind her should say ‘Amen’ to her prayers.’ I (the narrator) asked, ‘What should she then say?’ He (the Imam) replied that she should say, ‘O Allah, I appeal before You and You are Allah. Nothing is like You, so You do for me so and so things.’ My partner followed the instruction and she became clean. Thereafter she visited the Masjid.’ He has said that our housemaid had a similar case and asked me if she could also do what my partner had done. I said, ‘Yes, she also can do so. She also followed the instruction and it was successful.’” "

So the Prayer became Prohibited unto her (due to menstruation). Thus, due to that, a grievous matter entered into her (mind). So she feared that her <span class=\"iTxt\">Tumatto</span> would be missed, and she instructed me that I should mention that to you<sup>asws</sup>, and ask you as to what should she do?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘Say to her, so let her wash in the middle of the day and wear clean clothes, and sit in a clean place, and (other) women should sit around her saying ‘Ameen’ when she supplicates, and time being the decline of the sun.  ",
            "So, when the sun declines, instruct her, so let her supplicate with this supplication, and let the women say ‘Ameen’ upon her supplication, around her every time she supplicates. She should be saying, ‘O Allah<sup>azwj</sup>! I ask You<sup>azwj</sup> by every Name which is for You<sup>azwj</sup>, and by every Name You<sup>azwj</sup> are Named with for anyone one from Your<sup>azwj</sup> creatures, and it is Exalted, Treasured in the Knowledge of the Unseen with You<sup>azwj</sup>. And, I ask You<sup>azwj</sup> by the most Magnificent of Your<sup>azwj</sup> Names which, when You<sup>azwj</sup> are asked with, would be a right upon You<sup>azwj</sup> that You<sup>azwj</sup> Answer, that You<sup>azwj</sup> should Cut off this blood’. ",
            "So if the blood gets cut off, otherwise she should supplicate with this second supplication. So tell her, so let her say, ‘O Allah<sup>azwj</sup>! I ask You<sup>azwj</sup> by every letter You<sup>azwj</sup> Revealed unto Muhammad<sup>saww</sup>, and by every Letter You<sup>azwj</sup> Revealed unto Musa<sup>as</sup>, and by every Letter You<sup>azwj</sup> Revealed unto Isa<sup>as</sup>, and by every letter You<sup>azwj</sup> Revealed in a Book from Your<sup>azwj</sup> Books, and by every supplication supplicated to You<sup>azwj</sup> with by an Angel from Your<sup>azwj</sup> Angels, that You<sup>azwj</sup> should Cut-off this blood from me’. ",
            "So if it is cut off and she does not see anything in that day of hers, otherwise let her wash the next morning in a similar time, which she had washed the day before. So when the sun (starts to) decline, so let her Pray and let her supplicate with the supplication, and let the women say ‘Ameen’ when she supplicates. ",
            "So, the woman did that, and the blood was raised from her until she fulfilled her <span class=\"iTxt\">Tumatto</span>, and her Hajj, and she left returning. So when she ended up to the orchard of the Clan of Aamir, the blood returned to her. So I said, ‘Shall I supplicate with these two supplications and the end of my Prayer?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘Supplicate with the first one if you so like to, and as for the later one, so do not supplicate with it except during the descent of the terrible matter upon you’."

            "3. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Safmah ibn af-Khattab from Ali ibn al-Hassan from ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Uthman from ‘Abd Allah ibn Muskan from Bakr ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Azdiy Sharik abu Hamzah al-Thumaliy who has said the following: “I once said to abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, a Muslim woman accompanied me until we reached the gardens of banu ‘Amir, where she began to experience menses. She felt a great concern about losing her acts of al-‘Umrah. She asked me to mention it before you for an answer. He (the Imam) said, ‘Ask her to take a shower at noontime, dress in clean clothes, and sit in a clean place with women around her who should say ‘Amen’ for her prayers. She should keep doing so when the sun declines toward the west. She then say the following prayer and women behind should say ‘Amen’, £ 0 Allah, I appeal before You through every name that is Your name or with which You have named Yourself for any of Your creatures, or have treasured or kept high in Your hidden knowledge before You. I appeal before You through the greatest of Your great names, whereby if You are asked You deem it necessary to answer, please cleanse me of this blood.’ If it did not stop, she should say this prayer. £ 0 Allah, I appeal before You through every word that You revealed to Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. (I appeal before You) through every word that You revealed to Moses, through every word that You revealed to Jesus and through every word that You revealed in any of Your books, through every prayer with which any of Your angels have prayed before You to cleanse me of this blood.’ If it did not stop, she should do the same thing the next day at the same time. She should take a shower when the sun declines to the west, from a point verhead, say salat (prayer) and women should say ‘Amen’ for her prayer.’ That woman followed the instruction and she became clean. She performed all acts of al- £ Umrah and al-Hajj in clean condition and returned. As soon as we reached the gardens of banu ‘Amir, she experienced menses again. I then asked him (the Imam), ‘Can I say this prayers after my salat (prayer). He (the Imam) replied, ‘You can say the first prayer if you like but do not say the second unless it is a desperate condition.’” "
