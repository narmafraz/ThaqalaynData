She then went to al-Marwah and called aloud, ‘1s there anyone in the wilderness to provide relief?’ No one answered. Then she went back to al-Safa’ and did the same thing repeatedly seven times. Allah made this a tradition. Jibril then came and asked her, ‘Who are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the mother of the child of Ibrahim.’ He (Jibril) then asked, ‘In whose care did he leave you?’ She replied, ‘Since you say this, I, when Ibrahim was leaving, asked him, “O Ibrahim, in whose care are you leaving us?” He replied, “I leave you in the care of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious).”’ He (Jibril) said, ‘He has certainly left you in the care of one who is a sufficient caretaker.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘People would avoid traveling through Makkah because of water scarcity. The child kicked his heels to search for water and make Zamzam flow.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She returned from al-Marwah to the child when water had already gushed out. She piled soil to allow water to accumulate for fear of its flowing away; had she not done so it would have flowed.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When birds saw the water they began to circle around. At this time, a caravan from Yemen passing by saw birds circling; they said, ‘Birds circle only where there is water.’ They came to them (mother and child) who gave them water and they (people) in turn gave them food. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, in this way provided for them (mother and child) means of sustenance. People would pass by Makkah.

            "3. Muhammad ibn Yahya and Ahmad ibn Idris have narrated from ‘Isa ibn Muhammad ibn abu Ayyub from Ali ibn Mahziyar from al- Husayn ibn Sa‘id from Ali ibn Mansur from Kulthum ibn ‘Abd al-Mu’min al-Harraniy who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, commanded Ibrahim, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, to perform Hajj and that Isma‘il also perform Hajj along with him, and then settle him in the Sacred area. They went for Hajj on a red camel and there was no one with them except Jibril. When they arrived in the sacred area, Jibril said, ‘O Ibrahim, disembark and take a shower before entering the sacred area.’ They disembarked and took a shower. He (Jibril) instructed them how to prepare for Ihram, which they followed. He (Jibril) then commanded them to pronounce the reading to commence acts of Hajj and commanded to pronounce the four Talbiyat (O Allah, here I am O Allah; here I am to obey Your command). It is the pronouncement and the recitation, which is pronounced by the messengers. He (Jibril) went with them to al-Safa’. They then disembarked there. Jibril stood between them, facing the House. He said Takbir (Allah is great beyond description) and they also said Takbir (Allah is great beyond description). He said Tahlil (no one deserves worship except Allah) and they said Tahlil. He (Jibril) said Tahmid (all praise belongs to Allah). They also did the same. He (Jibril) pronounced Tamjid (all glory belongs to Allah). They also did as he had done. He (Jibril) praised Allah. They also praised Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, as he had done. He (Jibril) then moved forward. They also did as he was doing until they reached the Stone. He (Jibril) touched it and commanded them to do the same. He (Jibril) made them to perform Tawaf (walk seven times around the Ka‘bah). He (Jibril) then made them stand at the site of the station of Ibrahim. He (Jibril) performed two Rak‘at salat (prayer). They also did as he had done. He then explained to them how to perform the rest of the acts of Hajj, and when they completed the acts of Hajj, Allah commanded Ibrahim to go back. Isma‘il stayed and there was no one with him except his mother. The next time, Allah commanded Ibrahim to perform Hajj and build the Ka‘bah. Arabs would perform Hajj also, but it (al-Ka‘bah) had fallen in pieces; however, its foundation was clearly recognizable. Isma‘il collected the falling pieces of the wall; when people moved away, he placed them inside the Ka‘bah. When Allah commanded him to build, Ibrahim came and said, ‘Son, Allah has commanded us to build al-Ka‘bah.’ They uncovered it and it was one red piece of stone only. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, then commanded them to set the foundation of al-Ka‘bah on it. Allah, the Most Majestic, the most Glorious, sent four angels who collected stones for him. Ibrahim and Isma‘il would build and the angels would bring stones to them. When completed, it was twelve yards high and they made two doors for it: one entrance and one as an exit. They made steps for it and a canopy of iron for each door. Al-Ka‘bah had no covering. Ibrahim left when the House was complete and Isma‘il stayed. When people came to him, he saw a woman from Himyar. He liked her beauty and asked Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, to give her to him in marriage. She was already married, but Allah caused him (her husband) to die and she stayed in Makkah in sadness for the death of her husband. Allah granted her solace for the death of her husband and Isma‘il married her. When Ibrahim came for Hajj, she was a perfect woman. Isma‘il went to al-Ta’if to find food for his family. She, on the other hand, saw an old man who asked her about their condition and she informed him of their good condition. He then asked her especially about him. She informed him that he was a man of good religion. He then asked her, ‘Who are you?’ She replied, ‘I am a woman from Himyar.’ Ibrahim then left without meeting Isma‘il and he wrote a letter in which he said, “You must give this letter to your husband when he comes, if Allah so wills.” Isma‘il then returned to her and she gave the letter to him. He read it and asked, ‘Do you know who this old man is?’ She replied, ‘I found him beautiful. He resembled you.’ He said, ‘He is Ibrahim.’ She then said, ‘Woe is me!’ He asked, ‘Why do you say that, did he look at your beauty?’ She replied, ‘No, but I am afraid of my shortcomings toward him.’ She said it to him, and she was an intelligent woman, ‘Allow us to hang curtains over these doors, one here and one there.’ He responded positively. They prepared two curtains, each twelve yards long and hanged them over the doors and he liked them. She then said, ‘Why do I not weave clothes for al- Ka‘bah as a covering to cover it altogether; these stones look rough.’ Isma‘il said to her, ‘That is good.’ She began to work immediately and sent to her people for a large amount of wool to spin for her. “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘Woman’s spinning for each other is from that time.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘She worked quickly and sought help for this matter. As soon as she prepared a piece, she hanged it on the wall, but by the time of Hajj certain faces of the wall of al-Ka‘bah remained without cover. She then asked Isma‘il, ‘What should we do about this part that is not covered?’ They covered it with fibers of dates. At the time of Hajj, Arabs came to him and found something that was not there before, but they liked when they saw it. They said, ‘Something should be given to the keeper of this house. Each group of Arabs brought something, like leaves and other things, until a great deal was collected with them. They then removed the fibers, completed the covering for the walls and hanged the doors in place. Al-Ka‘bah did not have any roof so Isma‘il prepared pillars like the ones that you see from wood. Isma‘il made the roof with boards and leveled it with clay. Arabs came from places around it, entered al-Ka‘bah, saw the building and they said, ‘The keeper of this house should get more offerings.’ Next time they brought more offerings and Isma‘il did not know what to do about them. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent him revelation to slaughter them and feed them to people performing Hajj. He (the Imam) said, ‘Isma‘il then complained before Ibrahim for lack of water. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, sent revelation that said to Ibrahim to dig a well from which people performing Hajj can get water. He (Jibril) came and dug in the existing well, Zamzam, until water showed up. He (Jibril) then said, ‘O Ibrahim, climb down.’ He did as he was told to do and Jibril climbed down after him. He (Jibril) said, ‘O Ibrahim, dig in four corners of the well and say “In the name of Allah.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘Ibrahim dug in the corner near the House saying, “In the name of Allah” and a fountain gushed. He then dug in the second corner saying, “In the name of Allah” and another fountain gushed forth. He then dug in the third corner saying, “In the name of Allah,” where yet one more fountain gushed out. He thereafter dug in the fourth corner saying, “In the name of Allah” and the fourth fountain gushed forth. Jibril then said to him, “O Ibrahim, drink and pray for your offspring for blessing.” Both Ibrahim and Jibril came out of the well. He (Jibril) asked Ibrahim to leave for Tawaf around the House. This is the water that Allah gives to the offspring of Isma‘il. Ibrahim then left and Isma‘il escorted him until they were out of the sacred area. Ibrahim then left and Isma‘il returned to the sacred area.’” "

Ibrahim and Isma‘il built the House. They did it by doing a certain amount every day until they ended at the place where there is the Black Stone. Abu Ja’far has said that abu Qubays (hill), then called Ibrahim saying, ‘There is something in trust for you with me.’ It gave the Black Stone to him and he placed it in its place. Ibrahim then called people for Hajj saying, ‘O people, I am Ibrahim, the friend of Allah, and Allah commands you to perform Hajj of this House so you must perform Hajj.’ Thus, all those who up to the Day of Judgment perform Hajj answered his call. The first one who answered his call was from Yemen. He (the Imam) said, ‘Ibrahim, his family and children performed Hajj. Those who think that the person to be slaughtered was Ishaq they do so because of this.”’ It is said that abu Basir had heard this Hadith from abu Ja’far and abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhim al-Salam.

            "9. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father and Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad and al-Husayn ibn Muhammad has narrated from Muhammad ibn ‘Abdawayh ibn ‘Amir all from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn abu Nasr from Aban ibn ‘Uthman from abu Basir who has said the following:  “Abu Basir had heard abu Ja’far and abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhim al-Salam, who have said the following: “When it was the day of al-Tarwiyyah (eighth of Dhul Hajjah, meaning carry sufficient water) Jibril said to Ibrahim, ‘Carry a good supply of water, for which reason it is called the day of al-Tarwiyyah. He then went to Mina, where he spent the night. The next morning he went to ‘Arafat, where he raised a tent on Namirah near ‘Arafat, where he built a Masjid with white stones. The marks of Ibrahim’s Masjid were traceable until it was included in the Masjid built in Namirah, where the Imam leads salat (prayer) on the ninth of Dhul Hajjah. He said al-Zuhr and ‘Asr salat (prayer) there, then moved to ‘Arafat. He (Jibril) said, ‘This is ‘Arafat. You must learn the rules of the acts of your Hajj and confess your sins.’ For this reason, it is called ‘Arafat (learning and knowing). He then left for al-Muzdalifah (a place to move in), which is called as such because he moved toward it. He stood on al-Mash‘ar al- Haram and Allah commanded him to slaughter his son. He saw there his manners (morality), shapes (physical condition), and felt comfortable with him. When it was morning, he left al-Mash‘ar for Mina. He told the mother of the child to visit the House and kept the child with him. He then said, ‘Son, bring the donkey and the knife so I can offer the offering.’ Aban has said that I asked abu Basir, ‘What did he mean by donkey and knife?’ He replied, ‘He wanted to slaughter him and then load him on the donkey, ready him for burial and then bury him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The boy brought the donkey and knife and asked, ‘Father where is the offering (animal)?’ He replied, ‘Your Lord knows where he is. Son, you by Allah are he. Allah has commanded me to slaughter you, so what do you think about it?’ He replied, ‘Father, do what you are commanded to do and you will soon find me, if Allah so wills, one of those who exercise patience.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When he decided to slaughter him, he said, ‘Cover my face and tie down my legs.’ He said, ‘Son, tying and slaughtering! I will not do both of them together to you.’ Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, then said, ‘He then found the saddle of the donkey. He (Ibrahim ‘Alayhi al-Salam ) then asked him (his son) to lie down on it. He found the knife and placed it on his throat.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘At this time an old man came and asked, “What do you want from this boy?” He replied, “I want to slaughter him.” He then said, “Glory belongs to Allah. This is a child who has not committed any sins, not even for a blinking of an eye, and you slaughter him!” He said, “Yes, but Allah has commanded me to slaughter him.” He said, “In fact your Lord has prohibited you from slaughtering him. In fact Satan has commanded you in your dream to slaughter him.” He then said, “Woe is on you. The word is what you heard. It is He who has made me do what you see I am doing. By Allah, I will not speak to you.” He then decided to slaughter the boy. The old man said, “O Ibrahim, you are an Imam, people follow you. If you slaughter your son, people will slaughter their children. Wait.” He refused to speak to him’” Abu Basir has said that I heard abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say, ‘He made him to lie down near al-Jamarah al-Wusta’. Then he found the knife, placed it on his throat, then raised his head to the sky. Then he leaned on it but Jibril turned its back toward his throat. Ibrahim looked at it and found it backward. Ibrahim turned it on its sharp edge and Jibril turned it backward. He did it many times, then he was called from the left side of al-Khif Masjid, “O Ibrahim, you indeed made your dream to come true,” and he pulled the boy out from beneath him. Jibril fetched the ram from the top of al-Thabir hill and placed it underneath him. The filthy old man went out to find the old woman when she was looking to the House, which was in the middle of the valley. He said, ‘What kind of an old man is he whom I saw in Mina.’ He described him with Ibrahim’s descriptions and she said, ‘He is my husband.’ He then said, ‘I saw a servant with him.’ He described him by the description of her son. She said, ‘He is my son.’ He said, ‘I saw him make the boy lie down and he had the knife in his hand to slaughter the boy.’ She said, ‘This can never happen. I know Ibrahim is the most kindhearted man. How can you find him slaughtering his son?’ He said, ‘By the Lord of the heaven, by the Lord of earth and this House, I certainly saw him make him lie down with the knife in his hand to slaughter him.’ She asked, ‘Why?’ He replied, ‘He thought his Lord has commanded him to do so.’ She said, ‘He then is right to do so to obey his Lord.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘When she completed the acts of Hajj she felt severely moved because of the thought that something may have happened to her son. As if I can see her in the valley moving fast with her hand on her head and saying, “O Lord, do not punish me for what I did to the mother of Isma‘il.” He (the Imam) said, ‘When Sarah came and she was informed of the news, she stood up to her son and looked and found the marks of knife on his throat. She was horrified, complained, and that was the beginning of her illness which caused her death.”’ "

          "أَبُو عَلِيٍّ الْأَشْعَرِيُّ عَنْ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَبْدِ الْجَبَّارِ قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ عَنْ عَلِيِّ بْنِ النُّعْمَانِ عَنْ سَعِيدٍ الْأَعْرَجِ عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ( عليه السلام ) قَالَ إِنَّ الْعَرَبَ لَمْ يَزَالُوا عَلَى شَيْ‏ءٍ مِنَ الْحَنِيفِيَّةِ يَصِلُونَ الرَّحِمَ وَ يَقْرُونَ الضَّيْفَ وَ يَحُجُّونَ الْبَيْتَ وَ يَقُولُونَ اتَّقُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ فَإِنَّ مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ عِقَالٌ وَ يَكُفُّونَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ مِنَ الْمَحَارِمِ مَخَافَةَ الْعُقُوبَةِ وَ كَانُوا لَا يُمْلَى لَهُمْ إِذَا انْتَهَكُوا الْمَحَارِمَ وَ كَانُوا يَأْخُذُونَ مِنْ لِحَاءِ شَجَرِ الْحَرَمِ فَيُعَلِّقُونَهُ فِي أَعْنَاقِ الْإِبِلِ فَلَا يَجْتَرِئُ أَحَدٌ أَنْ يَأْخُذَ مِنْ تِلْكَ الْإِبِلِ حَيْثُمَا ذَهَبَتْ وَ لَا يَجْتَرِئُ أَحَدٌ أَنْ يُعَلِّقَ مِنْ غَيْرِ لِحَاءِ شَجَرِ الْحَرَمِ أَيُّهُمْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ عُوقِبَ",

            "(It has been narrated) from Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup> having said: ‘The Arabs did not cease to be upon something from the uprightness (The Religion of Ibrahim<sup>as</sup>). They were maintaining relationships, and were entertaining the guests, and performing Hajj of the House (Kaaba), and they were saying, ‘Fear (of consuming) the wealth of the orphans is a shackle’, and they were refraining from certain things of the Prohibitions fearing the consequential Punishment, and would not find any respite if they violated the Prohibitions, and they were taking from the bark of a tree of the Sanctuary, so they were hanging it in the neck of the camel (gifted to the Kaaba). So no one had the audacity that he would take it from that camel, wherever it may go to, nor was anyone audacious enough that he would hand something other than the bark of a tree of the Sanctuary. Whoever did that, faced punishment.",
            "And as for today, so it has been respited for them; and the people of Syria had come, so they had set up the catapult upon (Mount) Abu Qubays. So Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Sent a cloud upon them like the wing of a bird, so it rained thunderbolts upon them. Seventeen men were incinerated around the catapult’."

            "19. It is narrated that Ma‘d ibn ‘Adnan was afraid of the disappearance of landmarks of the Sacred area, so he placed special markings and he was the first to do so. Thereafter, Jurhum became dominant over the care taking of the House. They, generation after generation, were the caretakers until they became rebellious in Makkah and violated its sanctity, consumed its properties, and committed injustice against people who came to Makkah. Whoever transgressed and rebelled in Makkah, even during the time of ignorance, people who wronged others and violated its sanctity; any king who did so was destroyed right there and then. It was called Bakkah, because transgressors’ necks were crushed when committing transgressions therein. It also was called Basa’sah because wrongdoers were destroyed if they committed injustice therein. It was also called Ruhm, because those who took refuge there were granted mercy and kindness. When Jurhum transgressed therein and violated its sanctity, Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, send up on them fast-moving ants that destroyed them. Thereafter Khuza‘ah became dominant and gathered together to expel the remnants of Jurhum from the Sacred area. ‘Amr ibn Rabi‘ah ibn Harithah ibn ‘Amr was the chief of Khuza‘ah. ‘Amr ibn al-Harith ibn Musas al-Jurhumiy was the head of Jurhum. Khuza‘ah defeated Jurhum, and the remnant of Jurhum moved to a land of Juhaynah. A flood without rain came upon them, which drowned them. Khuza‘ah became the caretaker of the House and continued this task until Qusay ibn Kilab came and expelled Khuza‘ah from the Sacred area, took charge of the caretaking of the House and became dominant.
