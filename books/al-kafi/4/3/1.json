            "And as for the kissing and the submitting, so it is due to the reason of the promise and the renewal of that promise and the Covenant, and renewal of the allegiance in order to fulfil the promise to it which Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Took upon them in the Covenant. Therefore, they would be coming to it during every year and would be repeating that promise to it, and the entrustment which was Taken upon them. Do you not see that you are saying, ‘My entrustment I have fulfilled it, and my Covenant I have promised it in order for you to testify for me with the loyalty’? ",
            "And, by Allah<sup>azwj</sup>! No one apart from you Shias of ours<sup>asws</sup> are fulfilling that, nor is anyone preserving that promise, and the Covenant, anyone apart from our<sup>asws</sup> Shias, and they are coming to it, so it is recognising them and ratifying them; and when the others are coming to it, so it is denying that and belying them, and that is because it has not been preserved by other than you (Shias). ",
            "By Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, it would testify for you, and by Allah<sup>azwj</sup> it would testify against them with the disregard, and the ingratitude, and the disbelief; and it would be the eloquent Proof from Allah<sup>azwj</sup> against them on the Day of Judgement. It would come, and for it would be a speaking tongue, and two eyes in its former face. The creatures would recognise it and would not deny it. It would testify for the ones who were loyal to it and renewed the promise and the Covenant in its presence. ",
            "It preserves the promise and the Covenant and the fulfilment of the entrustment. And it would testify against everyone who denied, and strived against, and forgot the Covenant with the disbelief, and the denial. ",
            "So, as for the reason why Allah<sup>azwj</sup> had it to be brought out from the Paradise, so do you know what the (Black) stone was?’ I said, ‘No’. He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘It was an Angel from the great Angels in the Presence of Allah<sup>azwj</sup>. So when Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Took the Covenant from the Angels, and the first one to believe in it, and accept was that Angel. So Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Took it as a trustsee upon the entirety of His<sup>azwj</sup> creatures. So He<sup>azwj</sup> Caused it to devour the Covenant, and Entrusted it inside it, and Commanded the creatures that they should be renewing it in its presence during every year, accepting with the Covenant and the promise which Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Took upon them. ",
            "Then Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Made it to be with Adam<sup>as</sup> in the Paradise, reminding him<sup>as</sup> of the Covenant, and he<sup>as</sup> used to renew the acceptance in its presence during every year. So when Adam<sup>as</sup> disobeyed and came out from the Paradise, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Caused him<sup>as</sup> to forget the promise and the Covenant which Allah<sup>azwj</sup> had Taken upon him<sup>as</sup> and upon his<sup>as</sup> children, for Muhammad<sup>saww</sup>, and for his<sup>saww</sup> successor<sup>asws</sup>, and Made him<sup>as</sup> to be wandering, confused.",
            "So when Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Turned to Adam<sup>as</sup> (with Mercy and Forgiveness), Changed that Angel to be in the image of a white pearl, and had is cast from the Paradise to Adam<sup>as</sup>, and it was in the land of India. So when he<sup>as</sup> looked at it, he<sup>as</sup> felt love towards it, and he<sup>as</sup> did not recognise it, mostly because it was a jewel. And Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Caused it to speak, so it said to him<sup>as</sup>: ‘O Adam<sup>as</sup>! Do you<sup>as</sup> recognise me?’ He<sup>as</sup> said: ‘No’. It said, ‘The Satan<sup>la</sup> overcame upon you<sup>as</sup>, so he<sup>la</sup> made you<sup>as</sup> forget the remembrance of your<sup>as</sup> Lord<sup>azwj</sup>’. ",
            "Then it transformed itself to its image which it had when it was with Adam<sup>as</sup> in the Paradise. So it said to Adam<sup>as</sup>: ‘Where is the promise and the Covenant?’ So Adam<sup>as</sup> leapt to it and remembered the Covenant, and wept, and he<sup>as</sup> threw himself<sup>as</sup> at it, and kissed it, and renewed the acceptance with the promise and the Covenant. Then Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Changed it to the essence of the stone, being a white pearl, clear, illuminating. ",
            "So Adam<sup>as</sup> carried it upon his<sup>as</sup> shoulder due to its majesty for it, and its reverence. So whenever he<sup>as</sup> was exhausted, Jibraeel<sup>as</sup> would carry it on his<sup>as</sup> behalf until he<sup>as</sup> arrived at Makkah with it. So he<sup>as</sup> did not cease to love it in Makkah, and he<sup>as</sup> would renew the acceptance to it every day and night. Then when Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Built the Kaaba, Placed the Stone in that place because, when Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Took the Covenant from the Children of Adam<sup>as</sup>, Took it in that place, and in that place the Angel devoured the Covenant, and due to that it was placed in that corner.",
            "And Adam<sup>as</sup> moved away from the place of the House (Kaaba) to Al-Safa, and Hawwa<sup>as</sup> to Al-Marwa, and the Stone was place in that corner. So when Adam<sup>as</sup> looked from Al-Safa, and the Stone had illuminated in the corner, he exclaimed the Greatness of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> (<span class=\"iTxt\">Takbeer</span>), and extolled Him<sup>azwj</sup>, and Glorified Him<sup>azwj</sup>. Thus, it was due to that the Sunnah flowed with the <span class=\"iTxt\">Takbeer</span>, and the welcoming the corner wherein is the (Black) Stone, from Al-Safa.",
            "Therefore, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Entrusted the Covenant, and the promise with it apart from others from the Angels because when Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Took the Covenant for Himself<sup>azwj</sup> for the Lordship, and for Muhammad<sup>saww</sup> with the Prophet-hood, and for Ali<sup>asws</sup> with the successorship, the Angels trembled in awe, and the first one from them who hastened to the acceptance was that Angel. There has never happened to be among them anyone more intense for his love of Muhammad<sup>saww</sup> and the Progeny<sup>asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>saww</sup> than him, and due to that Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Chose him from between them, and Caused him to devour the Covenant, and he would be coming on the Day of Judgement, and for him would be a speaking tongue, and seeing eyes. He would be testifying for every one who had been loyal to it at that place, and preserved the Covenant’."

            "3. Muhammad ibn Yahya and others have narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad from Musa ibn ‘Umar from ibn Sinan from abu Sa‘id al-Qammat from Bukayr ibn A’yan who has said the following: “I once asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, ‘For what reason has Allah placed the Black Stone at the corner where it is and not in other places? Why should one kiss it, why is it taken out of paradise, why are servants of Allah’s covenant and undertaking placed in it and not in other things, and what is the reason for it? Explain to me and I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause. My thinking about this issue is strange.’ The narrator has said that he (the Imam) then said, ‘You asked it, complicated the issue and brought up many things. Understand the answer, make room in your heart (pay attention) and listen carefully. I will explain to you by the will of Allah. Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, placed the Black Stone, which is a special substance taken out of paradise for Adam, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. It was placed on the corner (of Ka‘bah) because of the covenant. This is because when the offspring of Adam were taken out of their backs, when Allah made a covenant with them on that place and at that place it (the Black Stone) was shown to them. From that place, the bird will fly for al-Qa’im, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. The first one to pledge allegiance with him will be that bird, and he by Allah is Jibril, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. Against that place will al-Qa’im lean his back. This is the guide and proof in favor of al-Qa’im. It is a witness in favor of those who fulfill their responsibility toward him (al-Qa’im), at that place, and the witness in favor of those who entrusted it with proof of their acting according to the covenant and undertaking Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, had made with them. The reason for kissing and touching the Black Stone is the covenant. It is to renew the covenant and undertaking and to renew the allegiance. It is for them to reaffirm in front of it (the Black Stone) the covenant that Allah had made with them on the day of covenant and undertaking. They therefore come to it every year to reaffirm in front of it the covenant and trust with which they were entrusted. Consider what you say in front of the Black Stone, “This is my trust which I am returning, my undertaking that I had assumed. So bear witness in my favor that I have fulfilled my obligation.” I swear by Allah, no one returns this trust except our Shi`a. No one has preserved that undertaking and covenant except our Shi ‘ah. They come to it (the Black Stone) and it recognizes them and acknowledges their truthfulness. Others come to it, but it does not recognize them and rejects their assertion; no one other than you has preserved the covenant. In your favor, by Allah, it will testify and against them. It will testify to their disregard of the covenant, their rejection and denial of the same. Such testimony will be the ultimate argument from Allah against them on the Day of Judgment. On that day, it (the Black Stone) will come, and it will have a speaking tongue and two eyes, in its original form. All creatures will recognize it and no one will deny it. It will testify in favor of those who fulfilled the obligation about the covenant, renewed their commitment and undertaking in front of it, reaffirming their commitment to preserve the covenant and undertaking and returning the trust. It will testify against those who deny, reject and forget the covenant, to prove them rejecters and unbelievers.’ “The reason why Allah took it out of paradise; ‘Do you know what the Black Stone was?’ I (the narrator) replied, ‘No, I do not know.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It was an angel of the great angels before Allah. When Allah made a covenant with the angels, the first to believe and affirm the covenant was that angel. Allah then chose him as a trustee for all of His creatures. He fed him the covenant and kept it with him for safekeeping. He then commanded all creatures to worship Him and to renew before it (angel, now the Black Stone) every year the covenant, the undertaking that Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, had made with them. Allah then assigned it with Adam in paradise to remind him of the covenant, and he would renew his confirmation before it every year. When Adam disobeyed and was expelled from paradise, Allah made him forget the undertaking and covenant, which Allah had made with him and his offspring in favor of Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and the executor of his will, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He left him lost and confused. When Allah accepted Adam’s repentance, He changed that angel to a white diamond and threw it to Adam from paradise, while he was in the land of India. When he looked at it, he found comfort with it but he did not recognize it. He did not know about it more than being a diamond. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, made it speak, saying, “O Adam, do you know me?” He replied, “No, I do not know you.” It then said, “Yes, Satan attacked you to make you forget to speak of your Lord.” It then changed into the form in which it lived with Adam in paradise. It then said to Adam, “Where is the covenant and undertaking?” Adam then rushed toward it, remembered the covenant, commitment, wept, expressed humbleness before it, kissed it and renewed the affirmation of the commitment and covenant. Then Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, changed it into the substance of the white diamond stone, very clear and shiny. Adam then lifted it up on his shoulder out of respect and its greatness. When he experienced fatigue, Jibril would pick it up until he brought it all the way to Makkah. In Makkah, he continued to seek comfort with it and renew his affirmation of the covenant every day and night. “Thereafter, when Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, built the Ka‘bah, He placed it at that place; when Allah, the most Blessed, the most High, made the covenant with the offspring of Adam, He did so at that place and at that place He fed the angel with the covenant. For this reason, it is placed at that corner. He moved Adam away from the location of the House to al-Safa’, Hawwa’ (Eve) was sent to al-Marwah and placed the Stone at that corner. When Adam looked from al-Safa’ he found that the Stone is placed at that corner, he said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), Tahlil (Only Allah deserves worship) and spoke of His glory. For this reason, it is the tradition to say Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) when facing, from al-Safa’, that corner where the Black Stone is placed. Allah has entrusted the covenant and undertaking with it and not with other angels. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, made them to form the covenant and confirm His being the Lord. (They were asked to confirm Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, as being the Prophet of Allah and to confirm Ali, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, as being the executor of the will. This made the angels tremble in awe. The first to rush to affirm was that angel. No one among them had such an intense love for Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, and his family as that angel did. For this reason, Allah chose him from among the others and fed him the covenant. On the Day of Judgment, he will come with a speaking tongue, seeing eyes, and will testify in favor of all those who had gone to that place and had fulfilled their obligation about the covenant.’” "
