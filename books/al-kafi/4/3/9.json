So when he ended up to this valley of Huzeyl, the people came over to him from some of the tribes, so they said, ‘You have come to the people of a city who have played with the people for a long time now, to the extent that they have taken their cities as sacred, and their buildings as male lords or female lords’.

            "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from al-Husayn ibn al-Mukhtar who has said that Isma‘il ibn Jabir narrated to him the following: “In between Makkah and al-Madinah, my companion and I were discussing about people called al- Ansar. One of us said that they were individuals from different people who did not belong to well- known tribes, and one of them said that they were from the people of Yemen. We then arrived near abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. He was sitting under a tree and he initiated the conversation, even though we had not asked him any questions. He (the Imam) said, ‘When Tubba‘ came from Iraq, along with him came men of learning and children of prophets. When he arrived in this valley of al- Hudhayl, people from certain tribes came to him and said, “You have come to the people of a town wherein they have played on people for a long time. They call their land as Sacred and their buildings as a male or female Lord.” He then said, “If that is true I will kill their fighter, take their offspring as captives and destroy their building.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘When he said this, his eyes came out of their place down on both sides of his face.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He called the men of learning from the offspring of prophets to think and find out why it has happened to him.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘They refused to tell him anything until he begged and pleaded before them. They then asked him, “Tell us about what you were saying to yourself before this happened to you?” He replied, “I said to myself that I will kill their fighters, take their offspring as captives and destroy their building.” They said, “The only reason for what has happened to you is what you said to yourself.” He then asked, “Why is it so?” They replied, “The land is the Sacred place of Allah, the House is the House of Allah, and its inhabitants are offspring of Ibrahim, the friend of the Beneficent.” He then said, “You have spoken the truth. How can I get out of what I have fallen into?” They said, “You must speak to yourself about something other than what you have done. There is hope that Allah may return you to your previous condition.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘He then spoke to himself about good things, his eyes returned back to their sockets and settled back therein.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He summoned the people who had asked him to destroy it and then he killed them all. He then went to the House, provided it with covering and served food to people for thirty days, every day with one hundred camels. The food was so much that they carried large containers of food to the mountaintops for the wild beasts there, and spread valuable items in the valley for the beasts. He then returned from Makkah to al-Madinah and asked the people from Yemen of the people of Ghassan to disembark and they are al-Ansar people.’” In another Hadith it says he covered it with al-Nata‘ (a covering with fragrance).

So Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> directed himself<sup>as</sup> to his companions to ask him to return his<sup>as</sup> camels back to him<sup>as</sup>, and he<sup>as</sup> sought permission to see him. So they got the permission for him<sup>as</sup> and said to him, ‘This is a nobleman of Qureysh, or a great one of Qureysh, and he is a man for whom is intellect and a personality.

            "2. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn abu ‘Umayr from Muhammad ibn Humran and Hisham ibn Salim who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said that when the Ethiopian king came with elephants to destroy the Ka‘bah, they passed by the camels of ‘Abd al-Muttalib and took them for themselves. ‘Abd al-Muttalib went to the king, asking him to release his camels. He asked permission for a meeting, which was granted. He (the king) was informed that he (‘Abd al-Muttalib) is the chief honorable man of Quraysh, an intelligent and kind man. The king received him honorably and allowed him to sit very near to the king. He then said to his translator, ‘Ask him what he needs?’ He (‘Abd al- Muttalib) said, ‘Your people when passing by my camels have taken them away. I like you to return them to me.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The king was surprised because of what he had asked, “Return my camels to me.” He said, ‘You think he is the chief of Quraysh and a very intelligent man. He neglects asking me to change my decision about his house of worship. Had he asked me to return back and change my decision I would have done so for his sake/ The translator informed him (‘Abd al- Muttalib) of what the king had said. ‘Abd al-Muttalib said, “This house has an owner who protects it. I ask you to release my camels because I need them.” The king ordered the release of his camels and ‘Abd al-Muttalib returned back. On the way, he saw the elephant on the border of the Sacred area. He said to the elephant, “O Mahmud.” The elephant moved its head in response. He asked, “Do you know why they have brought you?” The elephant with its head said, “No, I do not know.” He said, “They have brought you to destroy the house of your Lord with you. Will you destroy it?” The elephant with its head said, “No, I will not do so.” He (the Imam) said, ‘’Abd al-Muttalib then left. They brought the elephant to enter the Sacred area, but when on the edge of the Sacred area, it refused to enter/ They tried to force it but it refused to enter. They took the elephant in a circle around the Sacred area. On every point that they tried to force it to enter, it refused to do so and it did not enter. Allah then sent birds like swallows with stones in their beaks of the size of beans or so, and when on top of the head of a man, they released the stone and it pierced all the way down to come out of his anus. It continued until no one was left from them except one man, who fled and kept telling people about what he had seen. Suddenly one of those birds arrived above him. He raised his head and said, “This is one of them.” The bird came closer over his head and released the stone which pierced down all the way to come out from his anus and he died/” "

So the Qureysh intended to demolish the Kaaba and re-build it, and increase in its floor area. Then they refrained from that and feared that if they were to place the digging tools in it, the Punishment might descend upon them.",
            "So Waleed Bin Al-Mugheira said, ‘Leave me to begin, so if there was Pleasure of Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, nothing would hit me, and if it was other than that, we shall refrain’. So he ascended upon the Kaaba and moved a stone from it, and a snake appeared to him, and the sun was eclipsed. So when they saw that, they wailed and supplicated, and said, ‘O Allah<sup>azwj</sup> We are not intending except for the repairing!’ So the snaked disappeared from them, and they demolished it, and placed the stones around it until they reached the foundations which (Prophet) Ibrahim<sup>as</sup> had placed. ",
            "So when they intended that they increase in its floor area and moved the foundation which (Prophet) Ibrahim<sup>as</sup> had placed it, an intense tremor hit them, and there was darkness. So they refrained from it. And the building of Ibrahim<sup>as</sup> was of the length of thirty cubits, and the width was of twenty two cubits, and the ceiling was at nine cubits. So the Qureysh said, ‘We should increase in its ceiling’. So they build it. So when the construction reached up to the place of the Black Stone, the Qureysh quarrelled with regards to placing it. So every tribe said, ‘We are the highest with it. We should be placing it’. ",
            "So when (the quarrelling) became a lot among them, they agreed with fulfilling it by the one who entered from the door of the Clan of Shayba (of the Masjid). So Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> emerged, and they said, ‘This is the trustworthy one who has come’. So they made him<sup>as</sup> the judge, and he<sup>saww</sup> spread his<sup>saww</sup> cloak’, and one of them said, ‘This is a Taraouniyuun (a type of clothing) cloak which was his<sup>saww</sup>’. And he<sup>saww</sup> placed the Stone in it, then said: ‘There should come a man from every group of Qureysh’. So it was Utba Bin Rabi’e from the Clan of Abd Al-Shams, and Al-Aswad Bin Al Muttalib from the Clan of Asad Bin Abdul Uzza, and Abu Huzeyfa Bin Al-Mugheira from the Clan of Makhzoum, and Qays Bin Adayy from the Clan of Sahm. So they raised it, and the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> placed it in its place’.",
            "And a king of Roman had sent a ship wherein were tools, and roofing, and wood, and a group of builders, to Ethiopia in order to build a synagogue for him over there. So the wind cast it to the coast grounded. So the news of it reached the Qureysh, and they went out to the coast. So they found what was correct for the Kaaba, from the wood, and decorations, and other than that. So they bought these and went with it to Makkah. So that material was compatible with the construction except for the Stone. So when they built it, they clothed it with <span class=\"iTxt\">Al-Wasaaid</span>, and these were the fabrics’."

            "4. Ali ibn Ibrahim and others have narrated through various chains of narrators have narrated in a marfu‘ manner the following: “They have said that Quraysh had demolished al-Ka‘bah because of flood that would come from the upper part of Makkah and enter al-Ka‘bah. Damages would take place and a deer made of gold with its legs made of diamond was stolen. The walls were not high enough. This happened thirty years before Allah commanded His prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, to rise. Quraysh wanted to demolish al-Ka‘bah to rebuild and increase the size of its floor, but they were afraid of the coming of misfortune upon them because of using spades and shovels to dig. Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah said, ‘Allow me to try. If Allah is happy I will not be hurt; otherwise we will stop the work.’ He climbed on al-Ka‘bah and moved a stone there, a serpent came upon him, and the sun became dark. When they saw this, they cried and pleaded, saying, ‘O Lord, we only want to repair.’ The serpent disappeared; they demolished and removed the stones until they could see the foundations that Ibrahim had set. When they wanted to increase the size of its floor and moved the foundations that Ibrahim had put in place, a severe earthquake took place with darkness. They then gave up on the idea of increasing its floor. The length of the foundation that Ibrahim had set was thirty yards, its width twenty-two yards and its height nine yards. Quraysh wanted to increase its height. When the walls reached up to the Black Stone, they disagreed about setting it in place. Each tribe said that it had the right to set it in place. When the disagreement increased, they then decided to settle their disagreement by the first person entering through the door of banu Shaybah. The Messenger of Allah appeared to them through that door and they said, ‘This is al-Amin (most trusted person) coming to you.’ They asked him to decide the case; he then spread his gown, and someone said, ‘It is a Taruniy’ (name of a particular fabric). He placed the Black Stone on it and said, ‘One person from each Rab‘ (block of city) should come forward.’ The people who came forward were, ‘Utbah ibn Rabi‘ah ibn ‘Abd al- Shams, al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib from banu Asad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Uzza’, abu Hudhayfah ibn al-Mughirah from banu Makhzum and Qays ibn ‘Adiy from banu Sahm. They lifted up the Black Stone and the Holy Prophet set it in its place. On the other hand, the king of Rome had sent a ship with building material and builders to Ethiopia to built a temple for him there. The wind had blown the ship to the shore where it had run aground. Quraysh learned about it. They went to the shore and found certain materials useful for al-Ka‘bah, like wood, decorative materials and other things. They bought them and brought them to Makkah. The length of the wood was of the same measure as needed except al-Hijr. When they built it, they covered it with al-Wasa’id (a certain kind of fabric) which were in gowns.” "

When Qusay dominated Khuza‘ah, they did not know where Zamzam was, so it remained unknown to them. When ‘Abd al-Muttalib became dominant, furnishings for him were arranged in the shadow of the walls of al-Ka‘bah, and this was not done for anyone before. Once, when he was sleeping in the shadow of al-Ka‘bah, he saw in his dream that someone came and said to him, ‘Dig ‘Barrah.’ He asked, ‘What is Barrah?’ Next day he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Taybah.’ On the third day, he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Al-Masunah.’ He asked what is al-Masunah?’ Then on the fourth day, he came in his dream and said, ‘Dig ‘Zamzam,’ which will not dry up and will not be disliked. Great people performing Hajj will drink thereby near the red-footed crows that land near the colony of ants.’ There was a rock near Zamzam, on which red-footed crows would land every day to pick up ants for food. The ants had their colony under the rock near Zamzam. When ‘ Abd al-Muttalib saw this, he recognized the place of Zamzam. He then said to Quraysh, ‘I am told in four nights in my dream to dig Zamzam. It is our heritage and an honor for us; come, so we together dig the well.’ They declined his call and he himself began to dig the well and his only son, al-Harith, helped him in the digging. When digging became difficult, he moved to the door of al-Ka‘bah, raised his hands, pleaded before Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, and made a vow. In his vow he had said that if Allah will give him ten sons, he will offer the most beloved one among them as a sacrificial offering as an act of moving closer to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious. When he in his digging reached the walls of the well built by Isma‘il, he came to know of his reaching the water. He said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description) and Quraysh also said Takhir (Allah is great beyond description), saying, ‘O abu al-Harith, this is of our heritage and we have a share in it.’ He replied, ‘You did not help me, so you do not have any share in it, and it is for me and my children forever.’” "

            "A number of our companions, from Ahmad Bin Muhammad, from Al Qasim Bin Yahya, from his grandfather Al Hassan Bin Rashid who said, ",
            "‘I heard Abu Ibrahim<sup>asws</sup> (7<sup>th</sup> Imam<sup>asws</sup>) saying: ‘When Abudl Muttalib<sup>as</sup> dug Zamzam and ended up to its bottom, there came out to him<sup>as</sup>, from one of the sides of the well, a stinking odour which frightened him<sup>as</sup>, but he<sup>as</sup> refused to give up, and his<sup>as</sup> son Al-Haris came out (from the well). Then he<sup>as</sup> persistently, and he<sup>as</sup> found at the bottom, a spring which came out to him<sup>as</sup> with the aroma of musk. ",
            "Then he<sup>as</sup> dug, so he<sup>as</sup> had not dug except for one cubit until sleep overcame him<sup>as</sup>. So he<sup>as</sup> saw (in his<sup>as</sup> dream), a man of long hands, beautiful hair, handsome face, excellent clothes, aromatic perfume, and he was saying: ‘Dig, you<sup>as</sup> will achieve, and strive, you<sup>asws</sup> will receive, and do not hoard it for the distribution. The swords are for others and the well is for you<sup>as</sup>. You<sup>as</sup> are the greatest of the Arabs in worthiness, and from you<sup>as</sup> would be coming out, its Prophet<sup>saww</sup>, and its Guardian<sup>asws</sup>, and the excellent clan, the wise ones, the scholars, and visionaries; and the swords are for them.",
            "And today it is neither from you<sup>as</sup> nor for you<sup>as</sup>, but in the second century from you<sup>as</sup>, by them, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> will Enlighten the land and Exit the devils from its horizons and Humiliate them during their honour, and destroy them after their strength, and Humiliate the idols, and kill their worshippers wherever they may be. Then there would remain after it, a descendant from your<sup>as</sup> descendants. ",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> would be his<sup>saww</sup> brother, and his<sup>saww</sup> Vizier, and less than him<sup>saww</sup> in age, and he<sup>asws</sup> would be able upon the idols, not disobeying him<sup>saww</sup> by one letter, nor concealing anything, and he<sup>saww</sup> would be consulting him<sup>asws</sup> in every matter which would come up against him<sup>saww</sup>.",
            "And Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> was exhausted from it, so he<sup>as</sup> found thirteen swords leaning to the side of it. So he<sup>as</sup> took these and intended broadcast it, so he<sup>as</sup> said (to himself<sup>as</sup>: ‘And how can I<sup>as</sup>, and I<sup>as</sup> have not reached the water yet?’ Then he<sup>as</sup> dug, so he<sup>as</sup> had not dug a palm’s width until a horn of a gazelle and its head was see. So he<sup>as</sup> brought it out and in it was inscribed: ‘There is no god except for Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, Muhammad<sup>saww</sup> is Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup>, Ali<sup>asws</sup> is a Guardian<sup>asws</sup> from Allah<sup>azwj</sup>, So and so is the Caliph of Allah<sup>azwj</sup>’.",
            "So I (the narrator) asked him<sup>asws</sup>, ‘So and so, when would he be, before him<sup>asws</sup> or after him<sup>asws</sup>?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘He<sup>asws</sup> has yet to come after him<sup>asws</sup>, nor has anything from his<sup>asws</sup> conditions come yet’.",
            "So Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> came out, and the water had emerged, and he<sup>as</sup> realized, and he<sup>as</sup> was ascending and there was a black snake which had a long tail for it, preceding him<sup>as</sup> quickly to the top. So he<sup>as</sup> struck it and cut off most of its tail. Then he<sup>as</sup> sought it but it was lost, and so and so would kill it, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Willing.",
            "And it was from the opinions of Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> invalidating the dream which he<sup>as</sup> saw regarding the well, and he<sup>as</sup> kept the swords in sheets in the Kaaba. So Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Granted him the sleep, and he<sup>as</sup> was in a chamber of the Kaaba, so he<sup>as</sup> saw that very man and he was saying: ‘O praise-worthy one of (the Clan of) Shayba! Praise your<sup>saww</sup> Lord<sup>azwj</sup>, for He<sup>azwj</sup> would be Making you<sup>as</sup> to be a speaker of the earth, and the Qureysh would be following you<sup>as</sup> out of fear, and panic, and greed. Place the swords in their places’.",
            "And Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> woke up, so it astounded him<sup>as</sup>: ‘He came to me in the sleep. So if he is from my<sup>as</sup> Lord<sup>azwj</sup>, then he<sup>as</sup> is beloved to me<sup>as</sup>; and if he happens to be from Satan<sup>la</sup>, then I<sup>as</sup> think it would be a tail-less one’. But, he<sup>as</sup> neither saw anything, nor did he<sup>as</sup> hear a speech. So when it was the night, he came to him<sup>as</sup> in his<sup>as</sup> dream with a number of men and children. So they said to him<sup>as</sup>: ‘We are the followers of your<sup>as</sup> children, and we are from the dwellers of the sixth sky. The swords are not for you. Get married among the (Clan of) Makhzoum, strengthen yourself<sup>as</sup> and trade afterwards among the middle of the Arabs.",
            "So, if there does not happen to be wealth for you<sup>as</sup>, then for you<sup>asws</sup> is the nobility. Therefore hand over these thirteen swords to a child of (the Clan of) Makhzoum, and there would not appear to you<sup>as</sup> more than this; and one sword from it is for you<sup>as</sup>, for it would fall from your<sup>as</sup> hand. So you<sup>as</sup> will not find any trace of it except that such and such a mountain would be shielding it. It would therefore become from the condition of Qaim<sup>asws</sup> of the Progeny<sup>asws</sup> of Muhammad<sup>saww</sup>. ",
            "So Abdul Muttalib<sup>as</sup> woke up and went, and the swords were upon his<sup>as</sup> shoulder, and he<sup>as</sup> came to an area around Makkah. So a sword was lost from him<sup>asws</sup>. It was the most finest of these with him<sup>as</sup>. Thus, it would be appearing from there. Then he<sup>as</sup> entered in readiness for Umra and circumambulated with it. Upon his<sup>as</sup> shoulders were the swords and the two gazelles, performing twenty one circumambulations, and the Qureysh were looking on at him<sup>as</sup>, and he<sup>as</sup> was saying: ‘O Allah<sup>azwj</sup>! Make Your<sup>azwj</sup> Promise come True, and Affirm my<sup>as</sup> words for me<sup>as</sup>, and Publicise my<sup>as</sup> mention, and Strengthen my<sup>as</sup> arms’.",
            "And this was his<sup>as</sup> oft-repeated speech, and he<sup>as</sup> did not circumambulate the House (Kaaba) after his<sup>as</sup> dream regarding the well, with the quatrains of poems until he<sup>as</sup> died. But, he<sup>as</sup> recited a poem upon his<sup>as</sup> son<sup>as</sup> on the day he<sup>as</sup> wanted to sacrifice Abdullah<sup>as</sup>. So he<sup>as</sup> handed over the swords, all of them, to the Clan of Makhzoum – to Al-Zubeyr, and to Abu Talib<sup>as</sup>, and to Abdullah<sup>as</sup>. So there came to be four swords for Abu Talib<sup>as</sup> from that – one sword being for Abu Talib<sup>as</sup>, and a sword for Ali<sup>asws</sup>, and a sword for Ja’far<sup>as</sup> and one sword for Talib. And there were two swords for Al-Zubeyr, and there were two swords for Abdullah<sup>as</sup>.",
            "Then he<sup>as</sup> repeated, so there came to be four for Ali<sup>asws</sup>, the remainder being two for Fatima<sup>asws</sup>, and two for her<sup>asws</sup> children<sup>asws</sup>. So the sword of Ja’far<sup>as</sup> fell on the day he<sup>as</sup> was injured, and it is no known in whose hand it felt until today. And we<sup>asws</sup> are saying: ‘A sword from our<sup>asws</sup> swords will not fall to be in the hands of others except for a man who would assist us<sup>asws</sup> with it, along with us<sup>asws</sup>, but it would become rock/powder’.",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘From these (swords) is one in a (particular) location. It comes out like the coming out of the snake, so an arm and what resembles it appears from it, so the earth shines for it time and again, then it disappears. So when it is night time, it does similar to that. So these are its etiquettes until its master<sup>asws</sup> revives it. And had I<sup>asws</sup> so desired I<sup>asws</sup> would name its place, I<sup>asws</sup> would name him<sup>asws</sup>, but I<sup>asws</sup> fear upon you all that if I<sup>asws</sup> were to name him<sup>asws</sup>, so you (in turn) would reveal his<sup>asws</sup> name, and it would end up being linked to other than to him<sup>asws</sup>’."

            "7. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from al-Qasim ibn Yahya from his grandfather al-Hassan ibn Rashid who has said the following: “I once heard abu Ibrahim, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, say, ‘When ‘Abd al-Muttalib dug the well of Zamzam and reached its bottom, a foul odor emerged from one side of the well that frightened him severely. He could not bend himself down and his son, al-Harith, moved out of the well. He then dug until he found in the bottom of the well a fountain with the fragrance of musk. He then dug about a yard and sleep overcame him, so in his dream he saw a man with long hands, good looking hairs, beautiful face, fine dress and fragrance who was saying, “Dig, you will gain; work hard; you will be safe; and do not store it for distribution. The swords are for people other than you but the well is for you, the greatest of Arabs in honor, and from you will be the Prophet and people with Divine Authority, for the Arabs, as well as the noble ones; men of wisdom, great learning and great intelligent grandsons. The swords are for them and they are not today from you and not for you. However, in the next century from your time, Allah will brighten the land, expel Satans from its diameters, bring them low by its majesty, destroy it after its being strong, bring the idols low, eliminate the idol worshippers wherever they are found. Thereafter will remain a generation from your descendants who will be his brother and vizier, younger than him but powerful over the idols, who will not disobey him, not even one letter, or hide anything from him and will consult him in every matter that faces him.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib felt tired and he found thirteen swords leaned against one side of the well. He took them and decided to spread the matter. He (‘Abd al-Muttalib) then said to himself, “Why should I do this when I have not yet reached the water?” He then dug and after digging only about one foot, the horn of a deer appeared, as well as its head. He took it out and on it this was printed: “No one except Allah deserves worship and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, Ali is empowered with Authority of Allah and so and so is the deputy of Allah on earth.’” I (the narrator) then asked him, ‘The ‘so and so,’ when was he? Was he before or after him?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘He has not come yet, nor anything preliminary to his coming has yet come into existence.’ ‘Abd al-Muttalib then came out of the well with water coming after him and he encountered a black serpent with a long tail move before him quickly upward. He hit and cut most of its tail and then searched to find it but it disappeared. However, so and so is the one to eliminate it, if Allah so wills. It was of the decision of ‘Abd al-Muttalib to place the swords inside al- Ka‘bah against the walls to invalidate his dream in the well. Then Allah made sleep to overcome ‘ Abd al-Muttalib near al-Ka‘bah and he saw the same man in his dream who said, “O Shaybatu al-Hamd, praise your Lord; He will make you the tongue of the earth. Quraysh will follow you for fear, apprehension and for their greedy interest. Keep the swords in their place.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib woke up and answered him, saying, “He will come in dream; if he is from my Lord, it will be very beloved to me, but if it is from Satan, then I think it will be a tailless one.” He did not see anything and did not hear anything. When it was night he came in his dream with a number of men and children who said, “We are the followers of your children; we are the inhabitants of the sixth heaven. The sword is not for you. Marry in Makhzum people, you will be strong, work among Arabs. If you did not have money you have good relationships, so give these thirteen swords to the child from Makhzumiy people and no more than this will appear to you. One out of these swords is for you. It will fall off from your hand. You will not find any trace of it except that so and so mountain hides it. It then will be one of the preliminary issues prior to the rise of al-Qa’im, from the family of Muhammad, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, with divine authority.” ‘Abd al-Muttalib then woke up and left with the swords on his shoulder. He then went to a corner of the corners of Makkah and he lost one sword. It was the finest to him. It will appear from that place. He then entered Mu‘tamar (prepared to perform ‘Umrah), performed Tawaf around it, with it (swords) on his shoulder and the two deer, he made twenty-one Tawaf while Quraysh was looking at him; when he said, “O Allah, make your promise to come true, thus, establish my word, spread the word about me, strengthen my arms.” These were his repeated words. After his dream in the well, he did not do any Tawaf, while saying lines of poetry until he died. However, he spontaneously read a poem to his sons on the day he wanted to offer ‘Abd Allah, one of his sons, as a sacrificial offering. He gave all the swords to banu al-Makhzumiyah to al-Zubayr, to abu Talib, to ‘Abd Allah. Four of them went to abu Talib. One sword for abu Talib, one sword for Ali, one sword for Ja‘far, one sword for Talib, and for Zubayr there were two swords. For ‘Abd Allah there were two swords, then it returned and Ali had four swords. Of the rest, two were of Fatimah, ‘Alayha al-Salam, and two of her children. The sword of Ja’far fell off on the day he got hurt and no one knows in whose hand is it now. We say no one of our swords fell in the hands of one who is not one of us, except the man who helps us with it, but that it turns into charcoal.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘One of them is in the (special) location. It will come out like a serpent and an arm will appear from it or something similar to it. It will shine the earth many times, and then disappear, and then when it is night, it will do the same thing again. This is its manner until its owner comes. If I want I can give his name but I am afraid for you if I name him and then you will give his name, which then will be ascribed to one who is other than him.’” "

So when they came to building it, so they intended to (commence) its building, a snake came out to them, and it prevented the people from the construction until they fled. So they came over to Al-Hajjaj and informed him. So he feared that it was himself who had been prevented from building it. So he ascended the Pulpit, then adjured the people, and said, ‘I adjure with Allah<sup>azwj</sup> if any man has knowledge from what we have been afflicted with, that he should inform us with it’. ",

So Al-Hajjaj said, ‘Who is he?’ He said, ‘Ali<sup>asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>asws</sup>’. So he said, ‘That is a mine’. So he sent for Ali<sup>asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>asws</sup>, and he<sup>asws</sup> came over to him. So he informed him<sup>asws</sup> of what was from the prevention of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> from the construction.",

You deliberated to a construction of Ibrahim<sup>as</sup> and Ismail<sup>as</sup>, so you threw it in the street, and seized it as if you saw it as being an inheritance for you. Ascend the Pulpit and adjure the people that there should not remain anyone from them who had taken anything from it, except that he must return it’.",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘So he did that and adjured the people that there should not remain anyone from them with whom there is something, except that he must return it.

So when he<sup>asws</sup> saw the gathering of the soil, Ali<sup>asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>asws</sup> came over, and he<sup>asws</sup> placed the base and ordered them that they should be digging.

So they placed their building. So when its walls were raised, he<sup>asws</sup> ordered with the soil. So it was transferred and cast into its middle.

            "8. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn abu ‘Umayr from abu Ali Sahib al-Anmat from Aban ibn Taghlib who has said the following: “When al-Hajjaj destroyed al-Ka‘bah, people scattered its soil. When they wanted to rebuild it, a serpent came out on them, stopped people from rebuilding and they ran away. They went to al-Hajjaj and informed him of the matter. He feared that its rebuilding might have been prohibited. He went on the pulpit and swore people, saying, ‘I swear to Allah any servant who knows anything about the trial we are facing to inform us about it.’ He (the narrator) said, ‘An old man stood before him saying, “If anyone knows anything about this matter is the man whom I saw came to al-Ka‘bah, took something from it and went back.’” Al-Hajjaj asked, ‘Who is he?’ He replied, ‘He is Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam.” He said, ‘This is the source.’ He then sent his people for Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, who came to him, and he informed him of Allah’s prohibiting them to rebuild al-Ka‘bah. Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said to him, ‘0 Hajjaj, you have destroyed the establishment of Ibrahim and Isma‘il and threw it on the road. You looted it as if it was your inheritance. Now go on the pulpit and swear people (everyone) to Allah, to bring back everything everyone has taken, they have taken away from al-Ka‘bah.’ He (the narrator) said, ‘He, Hajjaj did so and swore people to Allah and asked everyone who has taken anything from al-Ka‘bah to bring it back.’ He (the narrator) said, ‘They returned everything back.’ When he saw the soil collected, Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, came, laid the foundation and commanded them to dig.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘The serpent then disappeared and they dug until they reached the site of the basis and foundations. Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, told them to move aside. They moved, he went closer and covered it with his clothes. He wept, then covered it with soil with his hand, then called the workers and told them to lay the foundation. They built the walls; when the walls were raised, he commanded them to fill the inside with soil. For this reason the floor of al-Ka‘bah is higher than the ground around and it requires a ladder to climb in it.’” "
