The Imam said, ‘You should give charity for his safety.’ When I was about to leave, he said, ‘Ask your son to give charity with his own hands; it can be a piece, a handful or even something very small. Anything whereby one can seek the pleasure of Allah with true intention, even though very small, is a great thing. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, says, “Whoever does a good deed, even if it is as small as the size of an atom, he will find its result; so also is the case of one who does a bad deed. (99:7-8) ”He has also said, “They have not yet entered al-‘Aqabah (mountain-pass). What do you think al-‘Aqabah is? Al-‘Aqabah is the setting free of a slave or providing food during a famine for a relative’s orphan or to a destitute person. (90:11-16)” He has also said, ‘Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, knows that everyone is unable to set a slave free. Thus, in the giving of charity, He has considered feeding an orphan or a destitute person the same as setting free a slave.’” "
