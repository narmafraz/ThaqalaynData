His companions said, ‘What the Jewish person said meant “death to you.’” The Holy Prophet said, ‘I said the same to you.’ The Holy Prophet then said, ‘A black serpent will bite him (Jewish man) on his back, and it will kill him.’ The Jewish man went and collected a great deal of firewood, then carried it on his back; after a short while, he returned. The Messenger of Allah asked him to leave his firewood on the ground. He agreed, not realizing there was a black serpent biting on a twig inside the bunch of firewood. The Messenger of Allah asked, ‘What did you do today, Jewish man?’ He replied, ‘I did not do anything other than collecting this firewood and moving. While returning, I ate one of the two cakes I had, and gave the other one as charity to a destitute person.’ The Messenger of Allah said, ‘Because of that charity, Allah protected you. Giving charity repels bad forms of death from man.’” "

In his dream, he was told, “One night, after going to bed with his wife, your son will die.” His father helped him to get married and when that night came, he was concerned about his dream. In the morning he found his son safe and alive. He went to him and asked, “Son, did you do any good deed last night?” He replied, “No, except that a beggar came to the door last night. They had spared some food for me, and I gave it to the beggar.” He then said, “Because of this, (Allah) has repelled misfortune from you.””’ "

            "11. Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from ‘Abd Allah from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from his father from Fadalah ibn Ayyub from those he has mentioned from Muhammad ibn Muslim who has said the following: “I was in the presence of abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. At that time, one of the extended over-hangings of the Masjid fell on a man and injured his leg. Abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, told us to ask him about what he has done today. When people asked him about it, he said, ‘When I came out of my home, there were some dates in my sleeve. I passed by a beggar and gave him one piece of date as charity. 5 Abu Ja’far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘That is the reason why Allah repelled misfortune from you.”’ "
