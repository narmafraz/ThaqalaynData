            "(It has been narrated) from Ali<sup>asws</sup> Bin Al-Husayn<sup>asws</sup>, said, ‘He<sup>asws</sup> said to me one day: ‘O Zuhry! From where have you come?’ So I said, ‘From the Masjid’. He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘In what (discussion) were you?’ I said, ‘We were mentioning the matter of the Fasting, so there was a consensus of my view, and the views of my companions upon that, there is no Fast which is Obligatory except for a Fast of the Month of Ramazan’.

            "So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘O Zuhry! It is not as you are saying it. The Fast is upon forty aspects. So ten aspects from these are Obligatory like the Obligation of the Month of Ramazan; and ten aspects from these, its Fasting is Prohibited; and fourteen from these, it’s doer is with the choice, if he so desires to, he may Fast, and if he so desires to, he breaks; and the Fast requiring permission is upon three aspects; and the Fast of disciplining, and the Permissible Fast, and the Fast of the journey and the sickness’. I said, ‘So, interpret these for me’. ",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘As for the Obligations, so these are the Fasts of the Month of Ramazan, and Fast of the two consecutive months regarding a expiation for the <span class=\"iTxt\">Zihaar</span> due to the Words of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> the Exalted  <span class=\"ibTxt\">[58:3] And (as for) those who put away their wives by likening their backs to the backs of their mothers then withdraw what they said, should free a captive before they touch them</span> – up to His<sup>azwj</sup> Words <span class=\"ibTxt\">[58:4] But whoever has not the means, let him fast for two months successively</span>; ",
            "And the Fasting of the two consecutive months for the one who breaks a day’s Fast from the Month of Ramazan; and the Fasting of two consecutive months regarding the killing in error for the one who cannot find the emancipation (of a slave), and Obligation due to the Words of Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic <span class=\"ibTxt\">[4:92] And it does not befit a Believer to kill a Believer except by mistake, and whoever kills a Believer by mistake, he should free a believing slave, and blood-money should be paid to his people </span>– up to the Words of the Mighty and Majestic - <span class=\"ibTxt\">but he who cannot find (a slave) should fast for two months successively: a penance from Allah, and Allah is Knowing, Wise</span>;",

            "And the Fast of (abstaining from) from shaving of the head (during Hajj) due to harm, is Obligatory. Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Says <span class=\"ibTxt\">[2:196] but whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, he (should effect) a compensation by Fasting or alms or sacrificing</span>. So it’s doer therein is with the choice. So if he wants to Fast, he Fasts for three days;",

",
            "Or, do you know what the equivalent of it in Fasting comes to be, O Zuhry?’ I said, ‘No, I don’t know’. He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘The hunted animal is evaluated with a fair price, then that price is converted into wheat. Then, that wheat would be divided in weight by Sa’as (units of measurement approximately 3 kg.), so he would Fast one day for each half Sa’a’.",
            "And the Fast for the vow is Obligatory; and the Fast for the seclusion in the Mosque (I’tikaaf) is Obligatory.",
            "And as for the Prohibited Fasts – So the day of (Eid) Al-Fitr; and the Day of the Sacrifice (during Hajj); and three days from the days of Tashreek (11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, and 13<sup>th</sup> of Zilhajj); ",
            "And the Fast of the day of doubt. We have been Commanded with it and we have been Prohibited from it. We have been Commanded with it that we should Fast it along with the Fasts of Shaban, and we are Forbidden from it that the man should be solitary with its Fasting during the day in which the people have doubts therein’. So I said to him<sup>asws</sup>, ‘May I be sacrificed for you<sup>asws</sup>! Supposing it does not happen to be a Fast from Shaban, anything, how would one deal with it?’ He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘He should intend on the night of the doubt that he is Fasting from Shaban. So if it was from the Month of Ramazaan, it would suffice from it, and if it was from Shaban, it would not harm him’. ",
            "So I said, ‘And how can a voluntary Fast suffice from an Obligatory one?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘If a man were to Fast a day from the Month of Ramazan voluntarily, and he does not know that it is from the Month of Ramazan, then he comes to know afterwards with that, it would suffice from it, because the Obligation, rather, occurred upon the day exactly’.",

            "And as for the Fast in which it’s does is with the choice – so it is the Fast on the day of Friday and the Thursday; and the Fast of the whiteness (four days of brightness in the middle of the month); and the Fasts during the six days of Shawwal after the Month of Ramazan; and the Fast during the day of Arafaat; and the Fast during the day of Ashura. So, during all that, it’s doer is with the choice. If he so desires to, he Fasts, and if he so desires to, he breaks.",
            "And as for the Fasts requiring permission – so the wife cannot Fast voluntarily except with the permission of her husband; and the slave cannot Fast voluntarily except with the permission of his master; and the guest cannot Fast voluntarily except with the permission of his host. Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> said: ‘The one who lodges upon a people, so he should not Fast voluntarily except with their permission’. ",
            "And as for the Fasts as a discipline – so the child can be seized with the Fasting as a discipline when he is an adolescent, and it is not with an Obligation; and similar to that is the traveller, when he eats at the beginning of the day, then he proceeds (back) to his family, so he refrains from the remainder of his day, and it is not with an Obligation.",
            "And as for the Permissible Fast, it is for the one who eats or drinks out of forgetfulness, or vomits from other than deliberately, so Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Permitted that for him, and his Fast would suffice for him. ",
            "And as for the Fast of the journey and the illness, so the general Muslims have differed with regards to that. So a group said, ‘He should Fast’, and the others said, ‘He should not Fast’, and a group said, ‘He can Fast if he so desires to, and breaks if he so desires to’. And as for us<sup>asws</sup>, so we<sup>asws</sup> are saying that he should break during both the states together. So if he were to Fast during the journey, or during a state of illness, so upon him would be its fulfilment (making up), for Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic is Saying <span class=\"ibTxt\">[2:184] but whoever among you is sick or on a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days</span>’.",

            "1. Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from af-Qasim ibn Muhammad af-Jawhariy from Sulayman ibn Dawud from Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah from af-Zuhriy who has said the following: “Ali ibn al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, one day asked me, ‘O Zuhriy, where from are you coming?’ I replied, ’I am coming from the Masjid.’ He then asked, ‘What were you doing there?’ I replied, ‘We were discussing the issues of fasting. It is my opinion and the opinion of my people that of all fasting, only that in the month of Ramadan is obligatory.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘It is not as you, O Zuhriy, say it is. Fasting is of forty kinds. Ten kinds of fasting are obligatory, just as is fasting during the month of Ramadan. Another ten kinds are prohibited. In fourteen kinds of fasting, one has the choice to fast or not to fast. For three kinds of fasting, one needs permission. One kind is for discipline, one is permissible, and one is fasting on a journey and fasting of an ill person.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for Your cause; please explain them to me.’ “The Imam then said, ‘Of the obligatory fasting there is (1) fasting during the month of Ramadan. (2) Two consecutive months of fasting are obligatory as expiation of zihar (swearing to consider one’s wife as one’s mother). This is because of the words of Allah, most High, “Those who pronounce zihar against their wives and then decide to take back their words must set free one slave before resuming marital relations . . . But those who cannot find this must fast for two consecutive months.” (58:2-3) (3) Fasting is obligatory for two consecutive months because of failing to fast one day in the month of Ramadan. (4) Two consecutive months of fasting are obligatory for killing a person by mistake for one who is unable to set free one slave and payment of wergild, blood money, to the people of the person killed. It is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who kills a believing person by mistake must set free one believing slave and pay blood money to the people of the person killed . . . but those who cannot do the above must fast for two consecutive months and repent before Allah. Allah knows all things and He is all wise.” (4:92) (5) Fasting for three days is obligatory as expiation for swearing because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “Three days of fasting (is obligatory) as expiation for swearing when you do so.” (5:89) This is when one is unable to serve food for this reason. All such fasting must be completed in consecutive order and without intervals in between. Of such obligatory fasting is (6) that due to shaving one’s head during Hajj due to discomfort in the head. This is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who is ill or feels discomfort in his head pays expiation in the form of fasting or serving food, or animal sacrifice. . .” (2:196) In this case, the person has the choice between serving food and fasting for three days. Of such obligatory fasting is (7) that due to Tamattu‘ (enjoying the interval between ‘Umrah and Hajj) and one’s inability to offer a sacrifice. This is because of the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, “One who enjoys (the interval) between ‘Umrah and Hajj and cannot offer a sacrifice must fast three days during Hajj and seven more days after Hajj at home. This makes it ten complete days of fasting.” Of such obligatory fasting is (8) that due to hunting. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “One who knowingly kills an animal must as penalty slaughter a similar animal. This is determined by two just persons deeming it to be similar with the animal hunted. Such an animal then must be offered as a sacrificial animal sent to Ka‘bah or he must serve food to destitute people or fast an equal number of days.’” (5:95) ‘Do you, O Zuhriy, know what is an equal number of days of fasting?’ the Imam asked. I (Zuhriy) replied, ‘No, I do not know.’ The Imam then said, ‘First, the price for the animal hunted is found. With such (money), wheat is then purchased and the total amount of wheat is divided into Sa‘ (about 3 kg) and for each one and half kilogram of wheat he has to fast for one day. Of such fasting is (9), that for an obligatory vow and (10) fasting for Ttikaf. ‘Of the unlawful fasting, there is (1) fasting on the first day of Shawwal, (‘id of al-Fitr), (2) on the tenth of Dhul Hajjah, (3-5) three days of al-Tashriq, 11, 12 and 13 of Dhul Hajjah. (6) Fasting (with an intention for fasting as a day of the month of Ramadan) is unlawful on a day that cannot be identified with certainty. In such a case, there is a command and a prohibition upon us. We are commanded to fast considering it as the last day of the month of Sha‘ban, and we are prohibited to fast considering it as the first day of the month of Ramadan when people have doubts about its being the first day of the month of Ramadan.’ I (Zuhriy) then asked, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, what happens if it, in fact, is not of the month of Sha‘ban at all?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘If he fasts with an intention of fasting a day of the month of Sha‘ban, and in fact, it happens to be of the month of Ramadan, his fasting is counted for the month of Ramadan. If one thinks it to be a day of the month of Ramadan and, in fact, it is a day of the month of Sha‘ban, it does not harm him in any way.’ I (Zuhriy) then asked, ‘How can an optional fast replace an obligatory fast?’ He (the Imam) replied, ‘If one fasts during the month of Ramadan with an intention for optional fast, it is counted for the obligatory fast of the month of Ramadan as a replacement. Of such fasting is (7) fasting for two days without any break in between, (8) the fasting to remain speechless and silent, (9) fasting for an unlawful vow, and (10) fasting for all the time is unlawful. ‘The fasting in which one has the choice is (1-2) fasting on Friday and Thursday. Of such fasting, are (3-6) the days (of brightness) in the middle of the month, (7-13) fasting six days of the month of Shawwal after the month of Ramadan, (14) fasting on the ninth of Dhul Hajjah, and fasting on the tenth of the month of Muharram. In all such days, one has the choice to fast or not to fast. ‘The fasting for which one needs to have permission is (1) fasting of a woman optionally; she needs to have permission from her husband; (2) a slave for optional fasting needs the permission of his master; (3) and a guest for optional fasting needs the permission of his host. The Messenger of Allah has said, “One who is a guest of a people must not fast without permission from his host.” ‘Of fasting for discipline (1) one is the fasting of a growing child (about to become mature) for discipline, not as an obligation. (2) Two is the fasting of a person on a journey who has used food at the beginning of the day, who should abstain from eating for the rest of the day when he arrives home, but it is not an obligation. Of the permissible fasting, is (3) the case of one, who by mistake, eats, drinks or vomits unintentionally; Allah for him has made it lawful and his fasting is considered valid. “About the fasting of a traveler and one suffering from an illness, ’Ammah (non-Shi`a) have different ideas. Certain ones among them say one must fast. Others say that one must not fast. Yet another group says that he may or may not fast, that the choice is his. We, however, say that in both cases he must not fast (it is unlawful fasting). If one fasts while on a journey or suffering from an illness, he must fast again later to make up for his invalid fasting. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Glorious, has said, “Those of you who are ill or on a journey must fast an equal number of days during other times.” (2:187) This is how fasting is explained.’” "
