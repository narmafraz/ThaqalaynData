Lineage, O brother of banu ‘Ijl, is when the means are men; and in-laws are when the means are women.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘I then asked about the meaning of the words of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, “Because of breastfeeding whoever is unlawful for marriage due to kinship becomes unlawful for marriage.’” He (the Imam) said, ‘Every woman who breastfeeds from the milk of her “impregnating agent” (husband) the child of another woman, girls or boys, it then is the kind of breastfeeding which is mentioned in the words of the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, “Because of breastfeeding unlawful becomes whoever is unlawful because of kinship relations.” However, if a woman breastfeeds a child with the milk of two impregnating agents that she may have had one after the other, and the child being a boy or a girl, it then is not of the kind of breastfeeding which is mentioned in the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah which says that what is unlawful because of the lineage is unlawful because of breastfeeding. It, because of the lineage of the in-law, is breastfeeding and it does not make anything unlawful when it is not for reason of breastfeeding from the side of the milk of ‘impregnating agent’ (husband) which makes it unlawful.’” "
