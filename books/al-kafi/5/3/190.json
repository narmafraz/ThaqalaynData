            "(It has been narrated) from Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup> having said: ‘There used to be a king among the Children of Israel, and he had a judge of his, and for the judge there was a brother who was a truthful man who had a wife who had given birth to Prophets<sup>as</sup>. The king wanted to send a man somewhere for a need, so he said to the judge, ‘Find me a reliable man’. So he said, ‘I do not know anyone more reliable than my brother’. So he called for him in order to send him, but the man disliked that and said to his brother, ‘I dislike it that I should be away from my wife’, and he was determined upon it. But, he could not find (a way out) from the going out and it was inevitable. So he said to his brother, ‘O my brother! I am not leaving behind anything more worrying upon me than my wife, therefore stay behind for her and govern her affairs with the fulfilment of her needs’. He said, ‘Yes’. ",
            "So the man went out, and the wife had disliked his going out. So the judge used to go over to her and ask her about her needs, and would stand by for her. He became fascinated with her, so he invited her to himself, but she refused upon it. So he swore upon her, ‘If you were not to do it, I would inform the king that you have been immoral’. So she said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I will not respond to you with anything from what you are seeking’. ",
            "So he went over to the king and said, ‘The wife of my brother has been immoral, and that is a right with me’. So the king said to him, ‘Purify her’. So he went over to her and said, ‘The king has ordered me with stoning you, so what are you saying, respond to me or else I shall stone you’. So she said, ‘I will not respond to you, so do whatever is a must for you’. So he brought her out, and had a pit dug out for her. So he stoned her and with him were the people. ",
            "So when he thought that she had died, they left her and dispersed. Then night came upon her, and there was still some breath with her. So she moved and came out from the pit. Then she walked over to her direction until she came out from the city, and she ended up to a monastery wherein was a monk. So she slept upon a door of the monastery. So when it was the morning, the monk opened the door and saw her. So he asked her about her story, and she informed him. So he pitied her and entered her into the monastery, and he had a young son and he did not have a son apart from him, and he was of a good state. ",
            "So he treated her until she was cured from her injuries and was healed. Then he handed over his son to her. So she used to look after him, and there was a manager who used to stand with his matters. So he was fascinated with her and invited her to himself, but she refused. So he struggled with it, but she still refused. So he said, ‘If you do not do it, I shall strive to kill you’. So she said, ‘Do whatever you have to’. So he deliberated to the young boy and cut off his neck, and went over to the monk and said to him, ‘You helped an immoral woman who had committed immorality, and you handed over your son to her, and she killed him’. ",
            "So the monk came over, and when he saw her, said to her, ‘What is this? And you know what I have done for you’. So she informed him with the story. So he said to her, ‘I am not happy with myself that you should be with me, therefore get out’. So he threw her out at night and handed over twenty Dirhams to her and said to her, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> will Increase this to suffice for you’. ",
            "So she went out at night and in the morning she was in a town wherein was a crucified man upon a wooden crucifix and he was still alive. So she asked about his story, and they said, ‘Upon him is a debt of twenty Dirhams, and the one upon whom was a debt, with us, his companion can have him crucified until he pays it to his companions’. So she brought out twenty Dirham and handed these over to his creditor and she said, ‘Do not kill him’. So they brought him down from the wooden crucifix. So he said to her, ‘There is no one greater to me than you. You rescued me from the crucifix and from the death. Therefore, I will be with you wherever you go to’.",
            "So he went with her, and she went until they both ended up to a coast of the sea. He saw a group of people and a ship, so he said to her, ‘Sit here until I go and do some work for them and get some food and come with it to you’. So he went over to them and said to them, ‘What is in this ship of yours?’ They said, ‘In this is merchandise, and jewels, and amber, and things for the trading, and as for this (ship), so we (sail) in it’. He said, ‘And how much would it reach to, what is in your ship?’ They said, ‘A lot, we cannot count it’. He said, ‘But, with me is something which is better than what is in your ship’. They said, ‘And what is with you?’ He said, ‘A slave girl the likes of whom you have not seen at all’. They said, ‘So sell her to us’. So he said, ‘Yes, upon a stipulation that one of you should go and look at her, then he would come to me and buy her, and not let her know, and hand over the price to me, and not let her know until I go away’. So they said, ‘That is for you’.",
            "So they sent someone to look at her, and he said, ‘I have not seen anyone like her at all’. So they bought her from him with ten thousand Dirhams and handed the Dirhams over to him. So he went away with them. So when he was at a distance, they came over to her and they said to her, ‘Stand up and enter the ship’. She said, ‘And why?’ They said, ‘We have bought you from your master’. She said, ‘He is not with my mastership!’ They said, ‘Either you stand up or we will carry you’. So she arose and went with them. ",
            "So when they ended up to the coast, they did not trust each other over her, so they made her to be in the ship wherein were the gems, and the merchandise, and they themselves sailed in the other ship, and they pushed it. Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Sent winds upon them which drowned them and their ship, and the ship which she was in was saved, until she ended up to an island from the islands of the sea, and she tied the ship and circled around in the island. So there was water therein, and trees wherein was fruit. So she said, ‘This water I shall drink, and the fruits I shall eat from, and I will worship Allah<sup>azwj</sup> in this place’.",
            "So Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic Revealed unto a Prophet<sup>as</sup> from the Prophets<sup>as</sup> of the Children of Israel, that he<sup>as</sup> should go to that king and he<sup>as</sup> should be saying: ‘In an island from the islands of the sea there is a creature from My<sup>azwj</sup> creatures. Therefore, you and the ones in your kingdom should go out until they come over to this creature of Mine<sup>azwj</sup>, and they should confess to it with their sins. Then they should ask that creature that it should seek Forgiveness for you all. So if she were to seek Forgiveness for you, I<sup>azwj</sup> shall Forgive you’. ",
            "So the king went out along with the people of his kingdom to that island, and they saw that woman, So the king proceeded to her and said to her, ‘This judge of mine came over to me and informed me that a wife of his brother had been immoral, so I ordered him with having her stoned, although he had not established the proof in my presence. Thus, I fear that I may have proceeded upon what is not Permissible for me, therefore I would love it if you were to seek Forgiveness for me’. So she said, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Forgiven you. Be seated’.",
            "Then her husband came over, and he did not recognise her, so he said, ‘There used to me a wife for me, and she was from the meritorious ones and righteous ones, and I went out from her and she disliked that. So I left my brother in charge over her. So when I came back, I asked about her, and my brother informed me that she had been immoral, and so she was stoned, and I fear that I may have lost her. So please seek Forgiveness for me’. So she said, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Forgiven you. Be seated’.",
            "So she made him to be seated next to the king, then the judge came over, so he said, ‘There used to be a wife of my brother, and she had astounded me, and I invited her to the immorality, but she refused. So I let the king know that she had been immoral and he ordered me with having her stoned, so I stoned her; and I had lied against her, therefore seek Forgiveness for me’. She said, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Forgiven you’.",
            "Then she turned towards her husband and she said, ‘Listen’. Then the monk proceeded and related her story and said, ‘I threw her out at night and I fear that she may have come across predators who mighty have killed her’. So she said, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Forgiven you. Be seated’.",
            "Then the manager proceeded and related his story. So she said to the monk, ‘Listen, Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Forgiven you’. ",
            "Then the crucified one proceeded and related his story. So she said, ‘Allah<sup>azwj</sup> will not Forgive you’. ",
            "Then she turned towards her husband, so she said, ‘I am your wife, and everything which you have heard, so it is my story, and there is no need for me with regards the men, and I would love it if you would take this ship and whatever is therein, and free my way, so I can worship Allah<sup>azwj</sup> Mighty and Majestic in this island, for you have seen what I have faced from the men’. So he did it and took the ship and whatever was therein, and freed her way; and the king and the people of his kingdom left’."

            "10. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Faddal from al-Flakam ibn Miskin from Ishaq ibn ‘Ammar who has said the following: “Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘In banu Israel there was a king who had a judge who had a brother who was truthful and had a wife who had given birth to prophets. The king decided to send a person for a certain task so he asked his judge to find for him a reliable person. The judge said, ‘I do not know anyone more truthful than my brother.’ He called him to go for the task but he did not like it and said to his brother, ‘I am afraid I may lose my wife.’ He insisted and the man could not do anything but to go for the task. He told his brother, ’Brother, of the things that I leave behind no other thing is more important to me than my wife. Please take good care of her in whatever matters she may need.’ His brother agreed and the man left for the task of the king but the woman did not like his leaving. The judge would come and ask her if she needed anything and would provide whatever she needed. He liked her and asked her to yield to his demand but she refused. He swore that if she did not agree he can inform the king that she has committed fornication. She said, ’I cannot yield to your demand and you can do whatever you like.’ He went to the king and said, ’The wife of my brother has committed fornication and it is proved before me.’ The king said, ‘Cleanse her.’ He went to her and said, ‘The king has commanded me to stone you to death. What do you say now? I can stone you to death if you do not agree with what I ask you to do.’ She said, ‘I cannot agree with what you wish, so you can do whatever you like.’ He took her out and placed her in a ditch and stoned, while people were with him. When he thought she was dead he left her and returned. When it became dark in the night and she was still alive she moved out of the ditch and dragged herself on her face out of the city to a monastery where a monk lived. She waited at the door until the morning when the monk opened the door, saw her and asked her about her story. She informed him about it, he felt sympathy for her, took her inside. He had a small son who was his only son in good condition. He treated her injuries until she was cured and gave his son to her to provide him care. The monk had an agent who worked for him. He liked the woman and asked her to yield to his demand but she refused. He tried hard but she did not yield to his demand and he said, ‘If you do not agree I will try to kill you.’ She said, T cannot agree with what you want, so you can do whatever you wish.’ He attacked the child and cut his neck. He went to the monk and said, ‘You entrusted a fornicator who committed fornication. You left your son with her and she has killed him.’ The monk came to her and when he saw him he asked her, ‘What is this? You know I helped you? She informed him of her story and he said, ‘I cannot feel good for you any more if you stay with me; so leave my place? He made her to move away in the night, gave her twenty dirham, told her to spend it and that Allah will sufficiently support her. During the night she left and in the morning she arrived in a town where a man was being crucified, but he was still alive. She asked about his case and they said that he owed twenty dirham which he could not pay. Whoever cannot pay his debts is crucified according to the rules of the town unless he pays it off to his creditor. She took out the twenty dirham, paid to his creditor and asked them to release him. They brought him down from the hanging pole and he said to her, ‘No one has ever done a favor to me greater than what you have done to me. You have saved me from being crucified and from death, thus I must serve you wherever you go? He followed her until they came to the shore and saw a group of people and a ship. He asked her, ‘Stay here so I go work for them to get food for you? He went to them and asked, ‘What does your ship carry?’ They replied, ‘It carries goods for business, like pearls, Ambergris and so on and we use this one for our own ride? He then asked, ‘How much is the value of the goods in your ship?’ They replied, ‘It is a great deal; we cannot count? He then said, ‘I have something with me who is better than what is in your ship? They asked, ‘What is with you?’ he replied, ‘There is a girl with me the like of whom you have never seen? They asked, ‘Do you sell her?’ He replied, ‘Yes, I want to sell her with the condition that one of you come with me to see her, then you can buy her from me and pay without telling her about it until I go away? They said; ‘It is up to you? They sent one of them to look at her and that person said, ‘I have never seen anyone like her in beauty? They bought her from him for ten thousand dirham and paid him. He moved away and when he was far away they came to her and told her to move in the ship. She asked, ‘Why must I move in the ship?’ They replied, ‘We have bought you from your master? She said, ‘He is not my master? They said, ‘Will you move on your own or we carry you in the ship?’ She then walked with them and when they arrived at the shore, they could not trust each other about her, so they kept her in the ship with goods for trading and they themselves stayed in the other ship and set it to sail. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, sent winds that made all of them drown as well as their ship but she remained safe with the ship loaded with goods for trading until she arrived in an island of the islands of the sea. She tied down the ship and walked on the island, found water, trees and fruits. She said, ‘From this water I will drink and from these fruits I will eat and worship Allah in this place? Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, then sent revelation to a prophet of the prophets of banu Israel to go to that king and tell him, ‘On such and such island there is one of My servants. You and the people in your domain must go to my servant who is there and confess your sins before My servant there then ask that creature to forgive you; if that creature forgives you I will also forgive you? The king along with the people in his dominion went to that island and saw a woman. The king came to her and said, ‘My judge told me that his brother’s wife has committed fornication and I commanded to stone her to death but no testimony was presented before me and I am afraid that I may have done something unlawful and I like that you ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you. Please sit down.’ Then her husband came. He could not recognize her and said, ‘I had a very excellent and virtuous wife but I left her when she did not like and I left her in the care of my brother. When I came back and asked about her, my brother told me that she had committed fornication and he stoned her to death and I am afraid that I may have lost her so ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you’, and she made him to sit next to the king. Then the judge came and said, ‘My brother had a wife who attracted me and I asked her to commit fornication but she refused and I informed the king that she has committed fornication and he commanded me to stone her to death. I stoned her to death and I had lied against her, so please ask forgiveness for me.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven you.’ She then turned to her husband and asked him to listen. Then the monk came and told his story and said, ‘I sent her away in the night and I am afraid that wild beasts may have killed her.’ She said, ‘Allah has forgiven, you please sit down.’ Then the agent of the monk came and told his story and she asked the monk to listen, may Allah forgive you. Then the man, who was to be crucified came and told his story but she said, ‘May Allah not forgive you.’ He (the Imam) said that she then turned to her husband and said, ‘I am your wife and whatever you heard is my story. I do not need any men anymore and I love that you take this ship with its contents and leave me by myself so I can worship Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, on this island. As you have learned how much I have suffered at the hands of men.’ He agreed, took the ship with its contents and allowed her to do what she wanted. The king and people in his dominion returned.’” "

But, the man refused and said, ‘I will not take except what I had evaluated upon you, and what was from the excess, so you are welcome to take it for your’.

            "15. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Ali ibn al-Hakam from Zur’ah ibn Muhammad who has said the following: “There was a man in al-Madinah and he had a very beautiful slave-girl who attracted a man who liked her and he complained before abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, who told him to avoid looking to her and on seeing her say, T ask Allah from His extra bounties.’ He followed the instruction. In a short time her master decided to leave for a journey and he came to the man and said, ‘O so and so, you are my neighbor and the most trustworthy of all people to me. I must leave for a journey and I like to leave so and so my slave-girl in your care.’ He replied, T do not have a wife and there is no woman in the house with me; then how can I keep your slave-girl with me?’ He said, T will find her price for you and you take responsibility of that assets (her price) for me and when I will come back, sell her to me and I will buy her from you. If you like to benefit from her it is lawful for you.’ He then did as he had said and made him responsible for the price of the slave-girl and left. She stayed with him as long as Allah wanted and he satisfied himself in what he wished. Thereafter a messenger of the Khalifah of Amawide came to buy slave-girls for him. She was one of those mentioned to be bought for him. The governor sent a person to him asking about the slave-girl of so and so. He said that so and so is not present. He was forced to sell and paid him with profits for him. When they took the slave-girl and left al-Madinah her master came back and the first thing he asked was about his slave-girl as to how she was doing. He informed him about what had happened and brought to him all that was paid for her; the price he had set and the extra profit and said, ‘This is the price and this is the profit, so accept it.’ He refused to accept more than the price he had set saying, ‘The extra is for you in good health. Allah did it for him because of his good intentions.’” "

When the seed falls in the womb those veins surge and ask Allah for resemblance to it. So this is from those veins which your ancestors did not get. Take your child with you.’ The woman said, ‘Thank you, O Messenger of Allah for providing me such a great relief.’” "

How is the Messenger of Allah compared to that man in matters of going to bed with his wife?’ She said, ‘He is no more than the other man.’ They left and the Holy Prophet came. She stood up frightened of the coming of something from the heaven and informed him of what had happened. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, became angry, his face turned overcast and perspiration due to anger emerged between his eyes. He (the Messenger of Allah) came out with his gown dragging behind him until he climbed on the pulpit. Al-Ansar (people of al-Madinah) hastened to pick up arms and commanded to ready their horses. He (the Messenger of Allah) climbed on the pulpit, praised Allah and spoke of His glory, then said, ‘O people, what is the matter with certain people! They spy on me to find my faults and ask about my private matters in my absence and behind my back. By Allah, I am the most honorable among you in matters of ancestry, of more clean birth, a provider of more sincere advice for the sake of Allah in one’s absence. Whoever of you may like to ask me about who his father is I can inform him about it.’ A man then stood up and asked, ‘Who is my father?’ He (the Messenger of Allah) replied, ‘He is so and so shepherd.’ Another man stood up and asked, ‘Who is my father?’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ’He is your black slave.’ A third man stood up and asked, ’Who is my father?’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘He is the one to whom you are ascribed.’ Al- Ansar then pleaded saying, ’O Messenger of Allah, forgive us, Allah forgives you. Allah has sent you as mercy so forgive us, Allah will forgive you.’ The Holy Prophet when spoken to would seem shy and perspire and would cast down his eyes before people due to shyness when they spoke to him. He (the Messenger of Allah) then climbed down the pulpit. At dawn Jibril descended with a dish of mashed meat and wheat from paradise and said, ‘O Muhammad, this is made for you by al-Hur al-‘In. You can eat it with Ali and his children; it is not proper that people other than you eat it.’ The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, Ali, Fatimah, al-Hassan and al-Husayn ate it (the food that Jibril had brought from paradise) and it gave the Messenger of Allah the ability in matters of going to bed with his wives which was equal to that of forty men, thus he (the Messenger of Allah) could go to bed with all of his wives in one night if he so wanted.’” "
