            "7. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Faddal from ibn Bukayr from certain persons of our people who have said the following: “About the case of a woman who marries a man and she as part of her mahr (dower) says that going to bed will be in her control as well as divorce, abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ‘It is against the Sunnah and has entrusted the right with one who is not the right person for it. Judgment requires that the man must pay mahr (dower). He has the right to go to bed and divorce and that is the Sunnah.’” "
