          "17- مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ يَحْيَى وَغَيْرُهُ عَنْ أَحْمَدَ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ عَنْ أَبِي هَمَّامٍ قَالَ سَمِعْتُ الرِّضَا (عَلَيْهِ السَّلام) يَقُولُ يُرَدُّ الْمَمْلُوكُ مِنْ أَحْدَاثِ السَّنَةِ مِنَ الْجُنُونِ وَالْجُذَامِ وَالْبَرَصِ فَقُلْنَا كَيْفَ يُرَدُّ مِنْ أَحْدَاثِ السَّنَةِ قَالَ هَذَا أَوَّلُ السَّنَةِ فَإِذَا اشْتَرَيْتَ مَمْلُوكاً بِهِ شَيْ‏ءٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْخِصَالِ مَا بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ ذِي الْحِجَّةِ رَدَدْتَهُ عَلَى صَاحِبِهِ فَقَالَ لَهُ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَلِيٍّ فَالإبَاقُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ قَالَ لَيْسَ الإبَاقُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ إِلا أَنْ يُقِيمَ الْبَيِّنَةَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ أَبَقَ عِنْدَهُ. وَرُوِيَ عَنْ يُونُسَ أَيْضاً أَنَّ الْعُهْدَةَ فِي الْجُنُونِ وَالْجُذَامِ وَالْبَرَصِ سَنَةٌ. وَرَوَى الْوَشَّاءُ أَنَّ الْعُهْدَةَ فِي الْجُنُونِ وَحْدَهُ إِلَى سَنَةٍ.

            "17. Muhammad ibn Yahya and others have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from abu Hammam who has said the following: “I once heard al-Rida’, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, saying, ‘Slaves, because of the happenings of the year are returned, such as madness, leprosy and Bars (leprosy).’ We then asked, ‘How is the return because of the happenings of the year?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘This is the beginning of the year. If you buy a slave with any of these things up to the month of Dhu al-Hajjah you can return to the owner.’ Muhammad ibn Ali then asked, ‘Are runaway slaves subject to this condition?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Runaway is not so treated, unless proof is presented that he was a runaway with the owner.’ It is narrated from Yunus also that the time for return in the case of madness, leprosy and Bars (leprosy) is one year. Al- Washsha’ has narrated that time for returning due to madness alone is one year.” "
