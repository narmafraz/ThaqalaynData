            "8. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Muhammad ibn Khalid from al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from Muhammad ibn al-Qasim who has said the following: “I once asked abu al-Hassan, Musa, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about a man who entrusted another man with a certain amount of property. The man with whom goods were left was from Arab people and he was not able to return anything. The other man was not able to do anything against him. The entrusting man was a filthy foreigner and has not asked for anything.’ He (the Imam) said to me, ‘Tell him to return his trust; he entrusted him with trust of Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious.’ I then said, ‘Ali ibn al- Nu’man has purchased from an ‘Abbaside woman a certain piece of their (land) and he has a document that says she has received payment; but in fact she has not received any payment. Should he pay her or refuse to pay?’ He (the Imam) said to me, ‘Tell him to deny paying her with strongest denial; she has sold what did not belong to her.’” "

            "9. Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad has narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Nahdiy from Kathir ibn Yunus from ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sayabah who has said the following: “When my father, Sayabah, passed away, one of his brothers came to me and knocked at the door. I went out to meet him. He offered me condolence and asked, ‘Has your father left anything?’ I replied, ‘No, he has not left anything.’ He then gave to me a bag with a thousand dirham in it and said, ‘Keep it (the capital) safe and use its profits.’ I went to my mother while I was very happy and informed her about it. During the night I visited a friend of my father and he purchased for me certain Sabiriy goods. I then opened a shop and Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, granted me a great deal of good things. The time for Hajj came and I felt in my heart about performing Hajj. I went to my mother and informed her of my feeling about performing Hajj . She then told me to return the dirhams of so and so. I then took the dirhams and gave it to him. He became so happy as if he had received a gift. He said, ‘Perhaps, it is not enough. I am ready to give you more dirhams.’ I replied, ‘No, I thank you. I desire to perform Hajj and I like that your thing is in your own possession.’ I left for Hajj and completed the acts of Hajj. I then returned to al-Madinah and along with people went to visit abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam. Appointment was not required for visitation. I sat in the last rows of people; I was young. People asked him questions and he (the Imam) answered them. When many people left and the gathering was reduced he (the Imam) pointed to me and I went closer. He (the Imam) asked, ‘Do you need anything?’ I replied, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I am ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sayabah.’ He (the Imam) asked, ‘What has your father done?’ I replied, ‘He has passed away.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘He (the Imam) expressed sorrow and sympathy.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘He (the Imam) then asked, ‘Has he left anything?’ I replied, ‘No, he has not left any thing.’ He (the Imam) then asked, ‘By what means then were you able to perform Hajj?’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘I explained to him the story of the man with dirham. He (the Imam) did not allow me to finish the story and asked, ’What did you do with the thousand dirhams?’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘I said, “I returned it to its owner.’” He (the narrator) has said that he (the Imam) said, ‘You have done a very good deed’ and he said to me, ‘Would you like if I give a good advice?’ I replied, ‘Yes, I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You must speak the truth and return a trust safely; you will share people in their wealth like this’ -he joined his fingers side by side. I followed his advice and was able to pay in charity three hundred thousand dirham.’” "
