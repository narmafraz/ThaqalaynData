            "6. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad from Yusuf ibn al-Sukht from Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Sulayman from al-Fadl ibn Sulayman from al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Isa who has said the following: “Once, Ali ibn Al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, was placed under pressure. He went to one of his Mawla’ (friend or follower) and asked him to lend him ten thousand dirham up to the time he is able to pay back. He (his friend) said, ‘No, because it is not with me; however, I want a promissory note.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘He (the Imam) tore a piece from his gown and said this is the promissory note.’ His Mawla’ did not like it and became angry. He (the Imam) said, ‘Am I more trustworthy or Hajib ibn Zurarah?’ He (his Mawla’) replied, ‘You are more trustworthy than Hajib ibn Zurarah.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘How is it that Hajib by depositing his bow, only a piece of wood, as a guarantee to bail out one hundred, also being a non-Muslim, kept up to his words and I will not keep up my word despite depositing a piece of my gown? 5 He (the narrator) said that his Mawla’ took the piece of his gown and lent him the dirhams and placed the piece of fabric in a container. Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, granted him ease and he (the Imam) took the dirhams to return to the man and said, ‘Here is the dirhams. Where is the promissory note (the piece of my gown)? He replied, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I have lost it.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You then cannot have your dirhams from me. One like me is not treated lightly in matters of trust.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘He then brought the container and the piece of fabric was in it. Ali ibn Al-Husayn, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, gave the dirhams to him and took the piece of fabric and threw it away and left.’” "
