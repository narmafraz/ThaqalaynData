Do you think I should give it to him to bring for me goods from Yemen?’ Abu ’Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, said, ‘Are you not aware that he drinks wine?’ ‘Isma’il replied, ‘Yes, this is what people say about him.’ He (the Imam) then said, ‘Son, do not give him your dinars.’ ‘Isma’il disobeyed his father and gave the dinars to him. He used them and did not bring anything. ‘Isma’il traveled, so also abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, for al-Hajj in that year. ‘Isma’il, when performing Tawaf would say, ‘O Lord, grant me reward and replace for me what I have lost.’ Abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, approached him and tapped him with his hand and said, ‘Hold it my son, by Allah, you have no ground for your argument before Allah and you have no right for receiving any reward or replacement for what you have lost, when you knew that he drank wine and you still trusted him.’ ‘Isma’il said, ‘O father, I did not see him drinking wine. I only heard people say so.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘My son, Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says in His book, “He believes in Allah and in the believers,” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:9#h62\">[9:62]</a> meaning he accepts (the words of) Allah (as true words) and accepts (the words of) the believers (as true words). When the believers testify before you then accept their words as true and do not trust one who drinks wine; Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, says in His book, “You must not give your assets to dimwitted ones.” <a href=\"/#/books/quran:4#h5\">[4:5]</a> Who can be more dimwitted than one who drinks wine? The speech (advice) of one who drinks wine has no beneficial effect, his intercession is useless and he is not trusted in matters of trust. Whoever entrusts him with his assets and he destroys it, such person does not deserve any reward from Allah for his loss or replacement from Allah.’” "
