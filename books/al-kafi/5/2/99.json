Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from Hammad from al-Halabiy who has said the following: “Once abu ‘ Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, was asked about the case of a man who made and advance payment to buy sheep of three and less than three years old and others for an appointed time. He (the Imam) said, ‘It is not unlawful if the one who must provide sheep cannot have all that he is responsible for; the buyer can have half, one-third, two-third with the capital of the rest of the sheep in the form of dirhams. They can take below their condition and not above the condition and this applies to sacks of wheat, barley and saffron and sheep also.’” "
