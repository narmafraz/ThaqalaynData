He bought it (perhaps on credit) for him and received the payment for it which remained with him. Then another man came and said, ‘Buy for me a cloth.’ He searched in the market for him, and then bought it for him and the payment for it remained in his hand. This was how business people exchanged goods among themselves. Then another man came and said, ‘O abu ‘Ummarah, I have a bundle of Kattan. Do you want to buy it to pay me after one year?’ He replied, ‘Yes, load it and deliver to me.’ It was delivered to him and he bought it to pay after one year. The man then left and a man from the market came and asked, ‘O abu ‘Ummarah, what is this bundle?’ He replied, ‘I have purchased this bundle.’ He asked, ‘Can you sell to me one-half of it and keep the price with you?’ He then purchased it and he gave him one-half of the goods for a payment of one-half of the price which remained in his hand for one year. He then would buy cloths with that fund, put one or two cloths on display, buy and sell, until he became affluent, able to show his face and find fame.’” "

He (the Imam) said, ‘What a slave has to do with an item found! He does not own anything for himself. A slave must not have bothered about it. He must announce it in public for one year. If the owner comes it must be given to him, otherwise, it remains in his belongings; and if he dies it becomes of his legacy for his children and those who inherit him. If no one comes to demand it, it remains in their belongings and it becomes their property; but if someone comes asking for it they must give it to him.’” "

So the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> was saying: ‘O Sa’ad! You are too pre-occupied with the world from the Prayer?’ So he was saying, ‘I do not want to waste my wealth. This man, I have sold to him and want payment from him, and this man, I have bought from him, so I want to pay him’.",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘So sadness entered into Rasool-Allah<sup>saww</sup> from the affair of Sa’ad which was more intense than his<sup>saww</sup> sadness with his poverty. So Jibraeel<sup>as</sup> descended and he<sup>as</sup> said: ‘O Muhammad<sup>saww</sup>! Allah<sup>azwj</sup> has Known your<sup>saww</sup> sadness with Sa’ad, so which of the two states of his is more beloved to you<sup>saww</sup>, the former or this state of his’. So the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> said to him: ‘O Jibraeel<sup>as</sup>! But, his former state, for his world has done away with his Hereafter’. So Jibraeel<sup>as</sup> said to him<sup>saww</sup>: ‘The love of the world and the wealth is a trial and pre-occupies from the Hereafter. Tell Sa’ad to return to you<sup>saww</sup> the two Dirhams which you<sup>saww</sup> had handed over to him, so his affair would come to be in the state which was upon him formerly’.",
            "He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘So the Prophet<sup>saww</sup> went out and passed by Sa’ad, and he<sup>saww</sup> said to him: ‘O Sa’ad! Do you want to return to me the two Dirham which I<sup>saww</sup> had given to you?’ So Sa’ad said, ‘Yes, and two hundred (even)’. So he<sup>saww</sup> said to him: ‘I<sup>saww</sup> do not want from you, O Sa’ad, except for the two Dirhams’. So Sa’ad gave him<sup>saww</sup> the two Dirhams.

            "38.

He always kept very close to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, at the times of all Salat (prayer) and did not miss any of them. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, sympathized with him greatly, looked after his needs and his poverty and said, ‘O Sa‘d, if something comes to me I will make you self-sufficient.’ It so happened that for a long time the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, did not get a chance and he (the Messenger of Allah) became depressed for Sa‘d. Allah, most Majestic, noticed how the Messenger of Allah felt about Sa‘d and Jibril came to the Messenger of Allah with two dirham and said, ‘O Muhammad, Allah has noticed how you feel about Sa‘d. Do you want to make him rich?’ He (the Messenger of Allah) replied, ‘Yes, I want to make him rich. Jibril gave him two dirhams and told him to give them to Sa‘d and instruct him to do business with them. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, took the two dirham then went out for Salat (prayer) and Sa‘d was standing at the door of the chambers of the Messenger of Allah waiting for him. When the Messenger of Allah saw him he said, £ 0 Sa‘d, are you good at trading?’ Sa‘d replied, ‘By Allah, I do not own anything to do trading. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, gave him the two dirham and told him to use them in trading and work for sustenance from Allah.’ Sa‘d took them and went with the Holy Prophet, until they performed al-Zuhr and al-‘Asr Salat (prayer). The Holy Prophet, said, ‘Go in search for sustenance; I was worried about your condition, O Sa‘d.’ Whatever Sa‘d bought for one he then sold it for two dirham and whatever he bought for two dirham he sold for four dirham and the worldly things began to move to him. His assets grew larger and his business became great. At the door of the Masjid he found a place where he sat and operated his trade. The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, came out for Salat (prayer) when Bilal said Adhan but Sa‘d was busy with the worldly things without wudu and unprepared unlike the way he did before he was engaged in trading. The Holy Prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, asked, ‘O Sa‘d, the worldly things have kept you busy and away from Salat (prayer).’ He replied, ‘What can I do? I do not want to waste my assets. From this man I must receive payment and to this man I must pay.’ He (the Imam) said that the Messenger of Allah began to feel sadder about Sa‘d than about his poverty. Jibril came and said, ‘O Muhammad, Allah has noticed your feeling about Sa‘d. Of his conditions which one you like: this condition or that one before?’ The Holy Prophet said, ‘O Jibril, I like his condition before because his worldly things have taken away his hereafter. Jibril then said, ‘The love of the world and its asset is a trial and deviates one from the hereafter. You must ask Sa‘d to return your two dirham that you gave him. His condition will change to that he had before.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘The Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, went out, passed by Sa‘d and asked, ‘Do you not want to return the two dirham I had given to you?’ Sa‘d replied, ‘Yes, indeed, I can give two hundred dirham.’ He (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘I just want the two dirham.’ Sa‘d gave two dirham to the Messenger of Allah, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause. He (the Imam) said that the worldly things turned away from Sa‘d until all that he had collected were gone and he returned to the condition he had before.’” "

I wrote to him again to inform him (the Imam) of my difficult condition and that I have been reading the Chapter for one year as the Imam had instructed and that I did not experience any change. He (the Imam) then wrote to me saying, ‘One year is passed, now read Chapter 97.’ I then read it for a very short time that ibn abu Dawud sent me something and paid off my debts and sent me and my family to al-Basrah as an agent to Bab Kala’ (name of a place) with a salary of five hundred dirham; and from al-Basra I wrote through Ali ibn Mahziyar to abu al-Hassan, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, explaining, ‘I had written to your father about so and so issues and had complained against so and so matters, I have found what I liked. I like to ask you about what I should do about reading Chapter 97, if I must continue reading it in my obligatory Salat (prayer) and others or there is a limit of time for it.’ He (the Imam) signed the answer and I read the signature that said, ‘You must not leave from Quran, short or long passages. Of Chapter 97 it is enough to read one hundred times in one day and night.’” "
