A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from Muhammad ibn ’Isma’il from Muhammad ibn ’Adhafir from ’Umar ibn Yazid who has said the following: “Abu ’Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, has said, ’If one owes a certain amount of debts to another person and he delays payment until the creditor dies and then he reaches a settlement with such person’s heirs whatever they receive belongs to them and the remaining belongs to the deceased who will acquire from him in the next life; but if he does not reach any settlement with the heirs of the deceased all of the loan belongs to the deceased for which the borrower will be held responsible.’” "
