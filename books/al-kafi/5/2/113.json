Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ‘Isma’il ibn Marrar from Yunus who has said the following: “I once asked al-Rida’, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the case of a cleaner man and a jeweler if they were liable. He (the Imam) said, ‘People do not behave well unless they are held liable.’ Yunus would act accordingly and hold liable.’” "
