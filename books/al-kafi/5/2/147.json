So when I got near to the arch of Al Kufa, I was informed that my companions had gone to the Nile. So I diverted towards the Nile. So when I got to the Nile, I was informed that my companions had gone to Baghdad. So I pursued him, and I was successfull with it, and I was free from what was between me and him, and we returned to Al Kufa, and the going and coming was of (a duration of) fifteen days’. ",
            "So I informed my companion with my excuse if he permits from it from what I had done, and I pleased him, so I extended to him fifteen Dirhams. But, he refused to accept. So we both agreed with (going to) Abu Haneefa (for a judgement). So I informed him with the story and the man informed him of it. So he said to me, ‘And what did you do with the mule?’ So I said, ‘I have handed it over to him, safely’. He (the owner of the mule) said, ‘Yes, after fifteen days!’. So he (Abu Haneefa) said, ‘And what do you want with the man?’ He said, ‘I want the hire charges for my mule withheld from me for fifteen days’. So he said, ‘I do not see for you a right, because he had hired it to Qas Ibn Hubeyra, so he differed and rode it to the Nile, and to Baghdad. So he is responsible for the price of the mule and the hire charges are dropped. So when he returned the mule safely and you took possession of it, the hire charges are not obligated upon him’.",
            "He (the narrator) said, ‘So we came out from his presence and the owner of the mule went on to say ‘We are from Allah<sup>ajwj</sup> and to Him<sup>asws</sup> we are returning’, due to what Fatwa Abu Haneefa had issued with. So I gave him something, and freed myself from him. Then I went on Hajj during that year. So I informed Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup> with what Fatwa Abu Haneefa had issued with. So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘It is due to these (types of) judgements and what resembles these that the sky withholds its water and the earth prevents its Blessings’. ",
            "He (the narrator) said, ‘I said to Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup>, ‘So what is your<sup>asws</sup> view?’ He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘I<sup>asws</sup> view for him, upon you, similar hire charges of a mule going from Al Kufa to the Nile, and similar hire charges of a mule riding from the Nile to Baghdad, and a similar hire charges of a mule from Baghdad to Al Kufa. Pay it to him’. So I said, ‘May I be sacrificed for you<sup>asws</sup>! I had fed it with Dirhams, so for me, upon him, would be its feeding (to reduce from the hire charges)’. So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘No, because you are a usurper’. ",
            "So I said, ‘What is your<sup>asws</sup> view, if the mule had been injured and died, would not that have been obligated upon me?’ He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘Yes, a price of a mule on the day you opposed him’. I said, ‘Supposing the mule had been affected by a fracture, or injury, or disease?’ So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘Upon you would be its price what is between the healthy and the faulty on the day you returned it to him’. I said, ‘And who would recognise that (difference)?’ He<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘You and him, and either he swears an oath upon the price, so it would be necessitated upon you. So if he were to return the swearing of the oath upon you, and you swear upon the price, that would necessitate upon him, or else the owner of the mule would come with witnesses who would be testifying that the price of the mule when it was hire was such and such, so it would be necessitated upon you’. ",
            "I said, ‘I had given him some Dirhams and pleased him with it, and he freed me’. So he<sup>asws</sup> said: ‘But rather, he was pleased with it and freed you when Abu haneefa judged against him with the inequity and the injustice, but return to him and inform him with what Fatwa I<sup>asws</sup> have issued with. So if he were to make you to be free after recognising it, so there would not be anything upon you after that’. ",
            "Abu Wallad (the narrator) said, ‘So when I left from that direction of mine to meet the hirer, I informed him with what Fatwa Abu Abdullah<sup>asws</sup> had issued to me with, and I said to him, ‘Say whatever you so desire to and I shall give it to you’. So he said, ‘Ja’far Bin Muhammad<sup>asws</sup> has become beloved to me and there has occurred the preference for him<sup>asws</sup> in my heart, and you are free, and if you so like that I return to you that which I have taken from you, I would do so’."

            "6. A number of our people have narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from ibn Mahbub from abu Wallad al-Hannat who has said the following: “I once rented a mule to Qasr ibn Hubayrah for both ways for so and so much amount. I left in search of my debtor and when I reached near the bridge of al-Kufah, I was informed that my debtor had gone to al-Nil. I then moved to al-Nil. When I went to al-Nil I was informed that my debtor had gone to Baghdad. I then followed him, found him and finalized whatever was between him and me and we returned to al-Kufah. Going and coming took me fifteen days. I informed the owner of the mule of my reasons for the delay. I wanted to make it a lawful deal and make him agree so I paid him fifteen dirham but he refused to accept it. We then agreed to go to abu Hanifah for judgment. I told my side of the story to him and the man also told his side of the story. He asked me, ‘What did you do to the mule?’ I replied, ‘I have returned it to him safely.’ He (owner) said, ‘Yes, after fifteen days.’ He asked, ‘What do you want from the man?’ He replied, ‘I want the rent for the mule which he kept for fifteen days.’ He said, ‘I do not see any such right in your favor because he rented it to Qasr ibn Hubayrah, and he then violated the agreement and rode it to al-Nil and to Baghdad, so he became responsible for the price of the mule and the rent became void. He then returned the mule safely to you and you have it in your possession so he is not responsible for rent.’ We came out of his office and the owner of mule kept saying, ‘To Allah we belong and to Him we all return.’ I felt sympathy for him because of the fatwa of abu Hanifah against him and I gave him something and asked him not to hold me responsible. I went for al-Hajj in that year and informed abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, about the fatwa of abu Hanifah. He (the Imam) said, ‘It is because of this kind of judgments that the sky stops sending water and the earth denies its blessings.’ I then asked abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al- Salam, ‘What do you say about it?’ I say that you must pay him a similar rent that is charged for a mule from al-Kufah to al-Nil, a similar rent for a mule that is charged from al-Nil to Baghdad, a similar rent that is charged for a mule from Baghdad to al-Kufah. You must pay him.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, I fed the mule with a cost of many dirhams so he must pay for the feed.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘No, because you usurped it.’ I then said, ‘What could happen if the mule died and was damaged, would he not hold me responsible?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘Yes, he could do so for the value of the mule on the day you went against the stipulation.’ I then asked, ‘What could happen if the mule became damaged, sustained injuries or so?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You would owe the price between healthy and damaged mule on the day you returned to him.’ I then asked, ‘Who could determine it?’ He (the Imam) said, ‘You and he (owner of mule) could do so. Either he had to take an oath to confirm the value for which you were responsible. If he turned the oath to you, you then had to take an oath about the value and it became binding on him or the owner of the mule had to present testimony and witness to prove how much the value of the mule was when it was rented and it became binding upon you.’ I then said, ‘I gave him a certain amount of dirham, he agreed and made it lawful in my favor.’ He (the Imam) said, ‘He agreed and made it lawful for you because of the fatwa of abu Hanifah, unjustly. However, you must go to him and inform him of my fatwa on this matter to see if he still agrees after knowing it, thereafter there will be nothing on you.’ Abu Wallad al-Hannat has said, ‘As soon as I returned I met al-Mukariy and informed him of the fatwa of abu ‘Abd Allah, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, and I said to him, “Now say what you want to say so I pay you.” He said, “I feel love for Ja’far ibn Muhammad in my heart and my heart says he has preference over the others. You do not owe me anything even though I love to return what I have taken from you, I still can do so.’”” "
