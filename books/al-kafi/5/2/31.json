            "6. Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Muhammad ibn Ahmad from al-Sayyariy from Ahmad ibn Zakariya al-Saydalaniy from a man of banu Hanifah from the people of Bust and Sajistan who has said the following: “I accompanied abu Ja‘far, ‘Alayhi al-Salam, in the year that he performed al-Hajj in the beginning of the Khilafat of al-Mu‘tasam. I once said to him (the Imam) when I was with him (the Imam) on the table in the presence of a group of the supporters of the Sultan, ‘Our governor, I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, is a man who supports you, Ahl al-Bayt and loves you. In his office there are taxes due on me. If you consider it proper, please write. I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, write to him a letter for me to kindly help me in this matter. He (the Imam) said, ‘I do not know him.’ I then said, ‘I pray to Allah to keep my soul in service for your cause, as I mentioned, he is one who loves you Ahl al-Bayt and your letter will benefit me in his office.’ He (the Imam) picked up a piece of paper and wrote, ‘In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Thereafter, the bearer of this letter that I have written has spoken good things about you. You must take notice that of your deeds what is for you is what you do good. Thus, do good to your brothers in belief. You must also take notice that Allah, most Majestic, most Glorious, will question you about things as small as an atom and mustard seeds.’ He (the narrator) has said, ‘When I arrived in Sajistan the news reached al-Husayn ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Naysaburiy, the governor. He came two farsakh from the city (twelve miles) away to meet me. I gave him the letter. He kissed it and placed it on his eyes. He then asked me about the kind of help I needed. I said, ‘In your office payable taxes are recorded against me and I need relief.’ He commanded to write it off, and said, ‘You do not have to pay taxes as long as I will have this work.’ He then asked about my family and their condition which I explained to him and he commanded to appropriate a certain amount for them enough for our expenses and with something extra. I did not pay taxes as long as he had that work and lived and he did not discontinue the grant that he had assigned for us.’” "
